One of the major operational strategies employed by ocean carriers is speed optimisation, so that vessel capacity, speed and service frequency can be adjusted to deliver emission reduction, in general with sizable benefits to the firm bottom-line. While the implications of speed optimisation for the industry and for cargo interests are in general well understood, the interrelations between speed optimisation and optimal vessel size are often overlooked. Moreover haul length, cargo value and fuel costs, as well as other operational parameters, are critical in the determination of optimal speed and vessel size.\r\nIn this manuscript optimal speed and vessel size are analysed as a function of other operational parameters. Through simulation, the paper shows that the GHG emission reduction generally attributed to speed optimisation is in reality the result of a joint optimisations of operations, where vessel deployment, network design and demand characteristics play a critical role. The paper main finding is that speed optimisation alone is not a sufficient condition for emission reduction, and that particular attention should be paid to the opportunity cost of cargo in transit and the availability of capacity.\r\n", :title "Emission Reduction through Speed Optimisation in Global Supply Chains", :keyword2 31, :authors (28478), :session 24}, 22 {:keyword1 95, :keyword3 116, :abstract "The standard quantitative analysis software for small to medium scale businesses has been established as, arguably, Microsoft Excel.

Solving this problem poses several methodological challenges. To this end, we have developed a powerful metaheuristic which was successfully applied to a large pool of realistic benchmark instances. Several analyses were conducted to shed light on the trade-offs between various performance indicators, including capacity utilization, fuel and emissions and costs pertaining to vehicle acquisition, fuel consumption and drivers.

In their case other drivers have been identified which suggest the need for a complementary approach in order to realise their individual development. \r\nIn this paper, we analyse four different arrangements for food supply design: direct distribution channels, supply chains, supply networks and supply communities. Elements such as challenge addressed, main driver, organisational principle, transactional direction and power structure are considered to provide a new description for the preference to a particular supply arrangement. Our contribution extends the notion of multi-actor supply arrangements beyond chains and networks, by considering supply communities that involve producers and consumers.  We introduce the notion of ‘community’ and use it to propose micro-producers as members of internally self-organised communities that may engage in the development of individual and collective supportive actions. To contextualise the discussion, we use the case of a typical UK regional, county-based food marketing group which provides umbrella marketing support for specialist SME and micro food businesses.", :title "Food Supply Arrangements", :keyword2 179, :authors (45930 45785), :session 247}, 122 {:keyword1 125, :keyword3 64, :abstract "Optimization models to support planning harvest season in apple orchards are developed.

Association rule mining is one of the techniques used to study the correlation between teaching means or students’ characteristics and their performance.

To fill the gap, this paper employs a game-theoretical model to investigate a two-sided platform’s decision-making on both pricing strategies and content management. We provide a comprehensive analysis by examining (1) platform’s objective, (2) relationship between platform content and seller participation, and (3) heterogeneity in platform adopters’ valuation towards platform content. Our results suggest that platform’s optimal strategies are significantly influenced by adopter heterogeneity and platform’s objective, while much less sensitive to the relationship between platform content and seller participation. Specifically, when adopters receive heterogenous benefits from platform content, the private platform’s strategies are independent from each other; the public platform cannot be self-sufficient to reach social optimality; the Ramsey platform’s strategies are complementary when network effects are strengthen, while substitutable when the cost for developing first-party content increases.

In the end, we analyzed the gains and losses of different interest groups caused by expropriation and media supervision. \r\nThe research found that large shareholders’ expropriation on minority shareholders will affect the process in two aspects in the presence of media monitoring. One is the relocation of interest between large and minority shareholders, namely the Wealth Distribution Effect. Large shareholders raise their own welfare level at cost of decreasing minority shareholders’ interest. The other is that large shareholders expropriation will lower corporate assets value, namely the Assets Impairment Effect.

Third, the possible commercial sites are determined by combining the results of the two previous steps, together with the use of kernel density analysis. Finally, depending on the resources available to the firm, multi-criteria decision models are used to help select the best location from among the possibilities identified in the previous analysis steps.

To demonstrate its practical applications, the proposed retail site location decision process was applied in the Spanish city of Murcia to decide on the location for a new supermarket opening.

A maximum number of vehicles for each category is imposed. Route length limitations hold for electric vehicles due to their small battery capacity, while no length restrictions are applied to routes performed by TVs. A maximum route duration is imposed for every route. EVs can visit every customer at any time, while TVs must respect a time window within which access to some customers is forbidden.

This hot state combined with the gravity effect creates a non-uniform thickness distribution in the plastic sheet. A good modelling and optimization of the heating process can improve the uniform distribution of the heat in the formed thermoplastic sheet. A natural way to achieve this goal is to reduce the differences of energy absorbed by different areas of the thermoplastic sheet. The classical methods of optimization of thermoplastics radiation have been the subject of many studies in the literature in finding the optimum solution of continuous and differentiable functions. These methods are analytical and make use of the techniques of differential calculus in locating the optimum points. However, since some of the practical problems involve objective functions that are not continuous and/or differentiable, the classical optimization techniques have a limited scope in practical applications. Therefore, one way to circumvent this difficulty is to make the problem discrete so one can use iterative processes so as to produce solutions rapidly, but without the optimality guaranty. Within this approach, we first discretized the problem so as an optimization problem can be produced.

Mixtures of the two are hardly ever studied. However, the model with periodic review and continuous ordering is highly relevant in practice, as information on the actual inventory level is not always up to date while making ordering decisions. This paper will therefore treat this model. Assuming zero fixed ordering costs, and allowing for a non-negative lead time and a general demand process, we first consider a one-period decision problem without salvage cost for inventory remaining at the end of the period. In this setting we derive a base-line optimal order path, described by a simple newsvendor solution with safety stocks increasing towards the end of a review period. We then show that for the general, multi-period problem, the optimal policy in a period is to first arrive at this path by not ordering until the excess buffer stock from the previous review period is depleted, then follow the path by continuous ordering, and stop ordering towards the end to limit excess stocks for the next review period. An important managerial insight is that, typically, no order should be placed at a review moment, although this may seem intuitive and is also the standard assumption in periodic review models. We illustrate that adhering to the optimal ordering path instead can lead to cost reductions of 30% to 60% compared to pure periodic ordering.", :title "Periodic Review and Continuous Ordering", :keyword2 101, :authors (45941 35181 46291), :session 438}, 245 {:keyword1 63, :keyword3 164, :abstract "In this paper, the problem of vendor selection and purchase order sizing for a single item is considered under dynamic demand conditions and uncertainties related to operational risks such as random or uncertain costs, demands of the buyer, capacity of vendors and the lead time.

This paper strives to develop a complete model of the underlying queuing process, taking into account both the problem of finding suitable surgery schedules for each room and the problem of finding an available bed for each patient that is subject to surgery, with a view to optimize the overall performance of the system. We present an integer-programming model for operating room scheduling optimization, which also includes a premise that the number of operations performed for each specialty must exceed the input rate of patients for that same specialty.

Under the exclusionary policy, only retailers who contribute their private information are exposed to the pool of shared information, whereas under the non-exclusionary policy, all of the members of the trade association are exposed to the pool of shared information regardless of any contribution to this pool. We show that when the wholesale price is exogenous, the retailers have an incentive to share information under both policies. However, when the manufacturer is aware of the exchange of information among the retailers, she sets the wholesale price more aggressively, even without being exposed to the actual shared information. As a result, under the non-exclusionary policy, no information is shared in equilibrium. Under the exclusionary policy, it is possible to reach a full information-sharing equilibrium, but this equilibrium can make the retailers worse-off compared with the case in which no information is shared.

The derivation of the performance measures with their monotonicity properties in their control parameters allows us to find the optimal control parameters for reservation and rejection. The two classes of policies for rejection are therefore compared.

Companies increasingly set long-term targets for multiple sustainability goals, e.g. CO2 emission reductions, recycling rates, preservation of jobs or ensured profitability. Decision support models need to answer if, how and when these multiple sustainability goals can be all achieved. Since complex dynamics and interrelations between these goals exist in a supply chain network, simple static scenario planning is insufficient either.

TTS minimizes the time frame until predefined targets for multiple sustainability indicators are achieved steady state.

Therefore, the growing of sugarcane has been of increasing importance in recent years in several countries. \r\nThese facts imply a need to produce large quantities of sugarcane and improve the quality of the resulting biomass to attend to the demand of the biofuels industry, which in turn requires a proper planning of the sugarcane crop cycle. It is often impossible for the manager of the mills to plan efficiently without the use of mathematical and computational tools. This is due to the great complexity and scale of the operations which also involve economic, social, environmental and political factors. Thus, generally an optimized planning in the sugarcane industry has a multiobjective character.\r\nThe planning of planting and harvesting of the sugarcane is of great importance for the mills, because an effective schedule promotes a series of benefits throughout the cultivation cycle and in the subsequent industrial use. In this study we propose a multiobjective model that optimises sugarcane production of each plot, the date the sugarcane is planted, and the date it is to be harvested. The model uses goal programming strategies to ensure the date of harvest is always within the period of the maximum maturation of the sugarcane and considers the demands and other operational constraints of the processing mill.\r\n", :title "A Goal Programming Methodology Applied to Planning of the Planting and Harvesting of Sugarcane", :keyword2 63, :authors (24012 3018 14289 37832), :session 176}, 404 {:keyword1 22, :keyword3 0, :abstract "When a disaster occurs the population of the endangered zone must be evacuated as fast as possible.

In such a situation it might be impossible to communicate the routes to the evacuees they have to choose to optimize the traffic flow, moreover it is difficult to ensure that the evacuees take the communicated routes. With our approach we optimize the traffic routing without determining optimal routes for every evacuee. In the developed method, the street network for a given traffic flow is optimized. With the blockage of street segments we reach an improvement of traffic distribution what leads to a better traffic flow and results in a faster evacuation. To integrate human behaviour every evacuee is modelled as an independent acting agent that chooses a route dependent on her preferences. So the individual behaviour of the evacuees and also the structure of the street network are integrated in the solution. In a computational study we compare our solution with the results from the unmodified network and with a solution where the optimal routes for every evacuee are given.

In a bid to discourage the use of the private motor-car and facilitate the uptake of public transport, there is a developing trend towards the construction of centrally-located Transport Hubs, allowing passengers to connect with multiple modes of transport. To assist passengers in connecting with their outbound mode more efficiently, it is desirable to synchronise connecting modal services within the Transport Hub. We consider the problem of designing shuttle-bus routes for passengers connecting with one of four different transport modes at a Transportation Hub. We seek to minimise the average waiting time for passengers, the cost of missed connections at the Hub and the total travel time. Furthermore, we incorporate time-of-day effects and passenger heterogeneity with respect to value-of-time. In addition to commuters, the framework developed is amenable and directly extensible to the perishable good delivery problem for which items possess heterogeneity in delivery priority. Our model is posed as an extension of the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and solved using column generation.

Due to the complexity of the problem, a heuristic is introduced to find good solutions in more realistic cases. This heuristic consists of two parts, a construction part and an analysis part. During the construction part, routes for the vehicles are constructed in the current network using a Variable Neighborhood Search.  In the second part of the heuristic, the constructed routes are analyzed to determine a good improvement of the network. A case study with a set of scenarios with a different number of customers and a different number of vehicles is executed.

The exact demand of each customer is only determined upon arrival at the customer’s location, but the demand distribution is known in advance and allows to plan routes, which simply specify the sequence of customers that each vehicle should visit. Due to the stochastic nature of demand, a planned route may fail to serve a customer, because its demand exceeds the residual capacity of the vehicle. Such an event is called a route failure. When a route fails, the vehicle must perform a recourse action by returning to the depot to replenish its capacity before proceeding with the remaining customers. This traditional recourse framework is quite rigid and it does not always make sense to wait until the route failure is confirmed before going back to the depot. \r\nIn this talk, we consider more flexible recourse actions that allow a preventive return to the depot when the residual capacity becomes too low. The specific strategies that we study are based on decision rules that account both for the distance to the depot and the risk of route failure. These policy-based recourse actions are implemented within an exact solution technique for the VRPSD.

The first heuristic is an approximate dynamic program (ADP) which approximates the value function using the value functions of the decomposed problems. The second heuristic is constructed directly from the optimal booking limits computed from the decomposed problems. Our numerical study suggests that the performances of both heuristics are close to optimum and significantly outperform a commonly used probabilistic non-linear programming (PNLP) heuristic in most of the instances. The dominant revenue performance of our second heuristic is evidenced in a case study using sample data from a major car rental company in the UK, which also sees higher fleet utilisation from our proposed policy.

When the future is modeled probabilistically, this leads to stochastic optimization, yet the formulation of objectives and constraints can be far from obvious. A future cost or hazard variable may be a random variable which a present decision can influence to some extent, but maybe only in shaping its distribution in a limited way.  For instance, it may be desirable to keep a hazard below a particular threshold, like building a bridge to resist earthquakes and floods, and yet it may be impossible or too expensive to guarantee that the threshold will never be breached.\r\n\r\nOne needs to have a standard according to which a cost or hazard is \"adequately\" below the desired threshold in line with its probability distribution. That is the role for so-called \"measures of risk,\" which started to be developed for purposes like assessing the solvency of banks but now are being utilized much more widely.  Measures of risk also offer fresh ways of dealing with reliability constraints, such as have traditionally been imposed in engineering in terms of bounds on the probability of failure of various manufactured components.  Probability of failure has troubling mathematical behavior in an optimization environment.

Based on the empirical results, we find evidence that the extent to which inventors span structural holes in the network is associated with higher innovation outputs. Furthermore, we find firms with greater reliance on familiar knowledge or on diverse knowledge have a significantly greater innovation return to their spanning of structural holes in the networks. Our findings indicate that a firm with reliance on diverse knowledge base is more capable of developing innovative outputs in the presence of internal knowledge sharing; a firm with reliance on its proprietary knowledge is better able to achieve superior innovation through internal collaboration. These results suggest the importance of fit between a firm's knowledge creation strategy and its internal network structure.

Second, we focus on the application of these OM principles: the law of variability, the law of utilization, and bottleneck management; we then show how these principles can be applied to computing resources. We illustrate this application by performing controlled laboratory tests. Results show that a better allocation of jobs, through the use of OM principles, could increase throughput and utilization of the system while reducing the amount of resources needed, including energy.

One approach to mitigate the issue is to cluster nearby customers around known parking locations. Deliveries from each parking location to its assigned customers occur by foot. These lead to long service times at each of the clusters. However, long service times in conjunction with time windows can lead to inefficient routes as nearby customer clusters with overlapping service times may not be connected. As a consequence, assigning additional service workers to each vehicle is a strategy to reduce service times. The trade-off between paying additional workers to reduce costs for vehicles and driving creates a new decision problem called the vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple service workers (VRPTWMS).\r\n\r\nThe present work introduces a stochastic cluster first, route second algorithm.

Also, the consumer demand is taken to be deterministic and linear in retail prices and advertising expenses. The price elasticities are taken to be constants for the product and so are same for both the brands for the manufacturing cycle.

The second phase validates the solutions of the first phase by a GRASP algorithm. In particular, the GRASP approach considers the packing problem for each route.

One of the methods that can be useful for this kind of problems is Jarvis' algorithm which has to be adapted to take account of connected nodes in a Euclidean graph. For this kind of networks, the complexity is reduced from O(nh) to O(kh^2), where n is the number of sensors, k is the maximum number of neighbors of a sensor in the network and h is the number of sensors of the envelope. The application of this algorithm to WSNs allows in each iteration to determine the next boundary neighbor of the current node. The advantage of this procedure is that each node knows its neighbor in a single operation. Then, each boundary node will periodically send a message to its neighbor, which should respond. If a response is not received, a situation of failure or intrusion will be triggered and network restructuring will be launched to find a new border.

Despite their wide use, it remains questionable regarding whether specifying these two measures only is sufficient and whether other significant information is lost. To investigate, we propose a flexible asset return model based on a standardised version of the normal and asymmetric Laplace (SNAL) mixture distribution which is able to generate arbitrarily large kurtosis for any level of skewness. For a given pair of skewness and kurtosis, it has additional free parameters that provide more delicate information about tail-fatness which cannot be captured by skewness and kurtosis. Under this model, the exact formulas for European option price and hedging parameters are derived in closed form and are compared to the approximate formulas based on Gram-Charlier and Edgeworth series expansion to examine the information loss by using skewness and kurtosis only.

In this paper, we present alternatives to the classical closest idle ambulance rule. We show that significant improvements can be obtained by these alternative policies. The first alternative is based on a Markov decision problem (MDP), thereby constructing the first known MDP model for ambulance dispatching. Moreover, in the broader field of Dynamic Ambulance Management, this is the first MDP that models more than just the number of idle vehicles, while remaining computationally tractable for reasonably-sized ambulance fleets. Second, we propose a heuristic for ambulance dispatching that can handle regions with large numbers of ambulances. For both alternatives, we focus on two performance metrics, namely, the fraction of late arrivals and the average response time. We evaluate our policies by simulating a large emergency medical services region in the Netherlands. For this region, we show that our heuristic reduces the fraction of late arrivals by 18% compared to the ‘closest idle’ benchmark policy.

We demonstrate using simulations that for heteroscedastic data (modelled by a multiplicative error factor) the proposed metric is far superior to MAPE for model selection. Another use for accuracy measures is in fitting parameters to prediction models. Minimum MAPE models do not predict a simple statistic and so theoretical analysis is limited.

To exploit network externality, the firm may charge different sales prices in different segments and offer free products in the leading segment. We show that a sales-dependent base-stock/offer-up-to/list-price policy is optimal. Network externality has several important impacts on the firm’s optimal policy. First, under network externality, the optimal order-up-to level and the optimal list-price in each segment are increasing in the previous-period leading segment sales volume. Second, when ignoring network externality, the firm overestimates potential demand, and overprices its product in both segments. Third, an additional following segment prompts the firm to lower the sales price and offer more free products in the leading segment. We demonstrate that the commonly used introductory price strategy, free-product strategy and price discrimination strategy all effectively exploit network externality and improve the firm's profit.

(1995).  To begin, all output variables, including desirable outputs and undesirable outputs, should be normalized to the-larger-the-better. Secondly, the ranking of output variables by importance is determined through the characteristics of the data and the correlation of inter-outputs; thus this is taken as an objective constraint.

The graphic output shows the value of sustainability, with the use of bars, bubbles and points. The numerical output is the “sustainability index”, given from the linear combination of three different indexes: environmental index, economic index and social index.

Metaheuristics frequently assume that the problem inputs, the underlying objective function, and the set of optimization constraints are deterministic.  However, uncertainty is all around us, which often makes deterministic models oversimplified versions of real-life systems.  This presentation describes a general methodology that allows for extending metaheuristics through simulation to solve stochastic COPs.  ‘Simheuristics’ allow modelers for dealing with real-life uncertainty in a natural way by integrating simulation into a metaheuristic-driven framework.

Although this area has been widely studied, the literature papers of sales forecasting from the perspective of multi-class classification is scarce. Since the fashionable products have short life cycle and heavily fluctuant selling quantities, it is very difficult to forecast their accurate sales quantities. Instead, we aim to forecast the market trend of such products. From a multi-class classification point of view, according to the selling quantity, the sailing market can be divided into three main parts, namely good, normal and bad, and accordingly the products can be attached three types of labels. For a certain fashionable product in multiple period selling horizon, since the normal selling quantity occurs more frequent than the good or bad selling quantity, forecasting the label type of this product can be viewed as a multi-class imbalanced classification problem, which is more complicated than the traditional classification problem. The method used in this study to deal with this problem is the newly proposed weighted extreme learning machine (WELM), which is an improved version of the extreme learning machine.

Scheduling highly occupied trains with more care restricts the probability that these trains get delayed and thus avoids their large impact on the total passenger travel time in practice in case of a delay.  Furthermore, having a sound grasp of recurring delays also allows making a better schedule. Time buffers before the recurrent delayed train will be longer in practice than the planned time buffers and time buffers after the recurrent delayed train will be shorter during performance.\r\nOn the other hand, we integrated two mixed integer programming models that construct a routing plan and a cyclic timetable from scratch which, respectively, optimally spread trains in space and time.

Empirical studies of the performance of negotiation support systems, however, predominantly consider just one support approach and dimensions of the negotiation outcome which are especially relevant for that support approach. Decision support focuses on efficiency and the economic value realized in an agreement, behavioral support on the other hand, often aims at effectiveness and thus the prospects of reaching an agreement. Differences in support systems, negotiation problems and cases as well as experiment participants impede the comparison of different negotiation support approaches across studies. This paper compares decision support and behavioral support implemented as functionalities of one support system and evaluated in one experiment. Analyses not only consider various outcome dimensions of the negotiation process – i.e. agreement as well as efficiency and fairness of agreements reached – but furthermore closely investigate the negotiation process. We unravel the black-box of the negotiation process by standardized interpolated path analysis, which uncovers how negotiation processes over time lead to the negotiation outcomes observed.

Heuristics use iterative processes to find better solutions. At each iteration, the next constructive movement is selected from a list of potential candidates that has been sorted according to some criteria. If the next best movement is always selected, the procedure could be seen as deterministic and iterative greedy. In order to obtain different outputs and, therefore, explore other solutions, randomization is employed to select next movements from the list. However, if a uniform distribution determines such randomization the logic behind the greedy behavior is faded away. To preserve the better features of the top listed candidates while maintaining the randomized behavior of the procedure, biased randomized algorithms have been proposed in a myriad of contexts. A biased randomized algorithm uses a biased probability distribution (e.g., geometric, triangular) to select the next constructive movement at each iteration.

The other addition is the assignment of weights to the nodes according to their relevant importance in the network. Since the MDS identification procedure essentially solves an integer programming problem that minimizes an objective function, the most important nodes (according to a selected attribute) are assigned inversely low weights. This forces the algorithm to select the most important node as a MDS element among a group of possible MDS nodes.

Each time production runs there are fixed and variable production/ordering costs that must be accounted for while controlling the system. The structure of the optimal control policy to this problem has been characterised over fifty years ago by Scarf. This control policy, named (s,S) monitors the inventory position, i.e. on hand stock minus backorders plus incoming orders, and issues an order to bring the inventory position up to S whenever the inventory position falls below s. In this work we develop an MILP based heuristic for computing nonstationary (s,S) policy parameters. The key insight upon which our approach is based comes from a recent study showing that a nonstationary (R,S) policy often performs very close to optimal. The idea is then to use an existing MILP model for computing nonstationary (R,S) policy parameters as a proxy to determine near optimal (s,S) policy parameters. Our heuristic is easy to implement, since it is based solely on a standard MILP model and on a simple binary search procedure.

Incorporating deterioration when finding an ordering quantity is very important to decision makers. Traditional markets in developing countries have the characteristic of discontinuous selling stages. For example, for those vendors who sell fresh vegetables at both morning and evening markets, after the former has closed there is a break of several hours before the latter starts. In this study, a discontinuous selling stages model for the deteriorated product is implemented to maximize profits and finding optimal ordering quantity. Numerical case study from real world is also provided to verify this model, and sensitivity analysis is conducted to find which parameters are more influential with regard to total profits and ordering quantity. The results show that selling price and demand have greater effects on profits, while the demand parameter has a significant effect on the ordering policy.

TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution) is one of the methodologies for solving the supplier selection problem. Among other computations, TOPSIS requires the determination of the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the negative ideal solution (NIS). The PIS is a matrix containing the best ratings for all criteria and all suppliers while the NIS is a matrix containing the worst ratings for all criteria and all suppliers. For each supplier, a similarity measure call closeness coefficient is calculated using the distances of each supplier from the PIS and NIS. These distances are calculated using a metric function. The closeness coefficients are used to rank the suppliers. The best supplier has the smallest value of the closeness coefficients. However, when several metric functions are adopted in some supplier selection problems, contradictory recommendations may be obtain. For example, if A3>>A1 means that supplier A3 is preferred to supplier A1, we may obtain A3>>A1>A4>>A2>>A5 and A3>>A1>>A2>>A4>>A5 when five suppliers A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are compared using two different metric functions.

To increase revenue, revenue management (yield management) is used in airline industry to maximise the profit through seven elements; customer behaviour and demand forecasting, control system, revenue factors, variable cost factors, fare products, problem scale, and problem interfaces. In control system, one factor is the overbooking concept which is selling tickets over the capacity to increase capacity utilisation in case of no-show probability of ticketed passengers. However, risks are involved when implementing an overbooking strategy. The main risk is that it is unknown how many passengers will show up or not at the time of departure for the flight. If the number of passengers show up for the flight exceeds the capacity, the airline has to deny passengers and have to compensate the denied passengers which will incur as a cost, decreasing the profit. It has been noted that most of the previous works used estimation or random probability on deciding the number of go-show or no-show passengers. This is impractical as in most cases there is no defined/known probabilistic behaviour that could model most of the aspects of oversold tickets problems. The aim of this research is to solve overbooking problem in the airline industry to maximize revenue using mathematical models based on fuzzy optimisation. This will assist in deciding how many overbooks are optimal per single-leg flight.

Furthermore, we determine respondents’ “consciousness for fair consumption (CFC)” and examine interactions between respondents’ level of CFC and price sensitivity. We found evidence, that generally the admission of a fair trade label increases respondents’ utility for an orange juice. On average, the willingness-to-pay for fair trade labels is about 25 Eurocent, which implies a price premium of approximately 15%.

For decades, a dominant strategy has been to outsource to low cost suppliers. This has led to the transfer of manufacturing jobs and development activities out of the U.S. and Europe, and into low labor cost countries such as China. In recent years, however, this trend is being challenged by some companies to re-shore manufacturing back to the U.S. or Europe, or to near-shore manufacturing to Mexico or Eastern Europe. In contrast to traditional analysis where labor cost savings are evaluated versus transportation costs, we propose a comprehensive stochastic model framework for this global sourcing location decision process that incorporates a full product life cycle perspective, i.e., product design, manufacturing, demand fulfillment, and after-sale service support. We derive optimal global sourcing strategies in order to test the validity of competing theories, and find that (i) Government policies such as lower corporate tax rates and greater financial subsidies can have a major positive impact on sourcing decisions; (ii) Technology developments (such as enhanced automation) can negate a landed cost disadvantage based on labor and variable inputs; (iii) Consideration of the capability to develop new products and higher service standards can override cost considerations in making sourcing decisions.", :title "Manufacturing Sourcing in a Global Supply Chain: A Life Cycle Analysis", :keyword2 75, :authors (17485 47424), :session 857}, 1426 {:keyword1 45, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This talk describes data mining and appointment capacity planning approaches which aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a London hospital’s breast cancer diagnostic clinic.

A typical assumption in warranty cost analysis is that the repair time associated with a warranty claim is zero.

Whilst some research has incorporated non-zero repair times, the repair time is typically assumed to be independent of the age of the product.  This research extends the literature by modelling consecutive repair times as an increasing geometric process. Warranties are often modelled using alternating renewal processes, in which both the operational time (\"on time\") and repair time (\"off time\") are modelled using renewal processes. This paper uses a generalised alternating renewal process (GAR), in which the operational time is modelled using a renewal process and the repair time is modelled using a geometric process.

Despite existence of successful trials and pilot projects, there are barriers preventing the successful development of a private EV market in its present state; investors are reluctant to invest in infrastructure due to the relatively small number of EV users, and conversely consumers are hesitant about purchasing EVs due high prices and a lack of charging infrastructure. It has been identified that introducing fast charging stations can aid this process, in particular by easing users’ concerns about running out of charge before reaching their destination. This study approaches the problem from the perspective of a central planner wishing to install fast charging stations. A multi-objective approach is used to simultaneously consider two conflicting objectives in the optimisation problem: (1)  to minimise the distance that potential consumers would need to deviate from their normal journeys in order to reach their nearest fast charging station and (2) to minimise the set up costs associated with the installation of the stations.

However, there is another major concern, namely, the presence of endogeneity in the production process, which is frequently overlooked when practitioners apply DEA even though it is an issue that has received plenty of attention in econometrics. In a recent work Cordero, Santín and Sicilia (2015) analyse the distortions in the DEA estimates caused by high positive endogeneity. That is, when at least one input in the production process is positively correlated with the true efficiency level. Therefore, two key issues emerge now: how can be endogeneity detected in empirical analysis and how can this problem be overcome in DEA applications. These are the aims of the present research. To do this, we use synthetic data generated in a Monte Carlo experiment to compare different endogenous scenarios with an exogenous one. As a result, we propose a simple statistical procedure which allows practitioners to identify the presence of an endogenous input in an empirical application. In addition, we evaluate a potential solution to deal with this problem in order to improve DEA estimations through an “instrument input”.

With an increasing number of scenarios the resulting MILP problems become very hard to solve in a monolithic fashion. To find good solutions in reasonable computation times, in our previous work stage decomposition was successfully applied to solve 2SSP. The first stage problem is solved by an evolutionary algorithm, while the second-stage subproblems are solved exactly by a MILP-solver. So for each tested solution for the first-stage variables, all scenario subproblems have been solved to optimality.\r\nWe present a new idea for solving large-scale 2SSP under uncertainty based on stage decomposition and the principles of Ordinal Optimization (OO). According to OO it is easier to create a ranking of multiple solutions than evaluating their exact values.

For more than four decades the idea to interpret single-track train scheduling problems as job-shop problems has been applied to find feasible, near-optimal solutions, since the underlying combinatorial optimization problem is known to be NP-complete. Trains are to be scheduled according to given routes in networks consisting of single-tracks, sidings and stations with predefined entry and desired leaving times. In order to increase planning certainty in adjacent railway networks the optimization criterion is the minimization of total tardiness of all trains. The presented IP-formulations additionally include blocking restrictions, which refer to a train blocking a track section until the succeeding section on its route is free to travel. Two approaches to transform a railway network to machines differentiated by the inclusion of platforming flexibility in stations are applied. Furthermore modeling alternatives with decision variables defining precedence relations between operations on one hand and assigning operations to order positions on machines on the other hand are set up and discussed.

We solve a MIP formulation for the QCSP decomposing it into a vehicle routing problem and a corresponding scheduling problem. The routing sub-problem is solved by minimizing the longest crane completion time without taking crane interference into account. This solution provides a lower bound for the makespan of the whole problem and is sent to the scheduling sub-problem, where a completion time for each task and the makespan are determined. This information is used to update the best solution found and to provide cuts to the routing problem. Cuts are used to avoid the generation of the same or similar routes that cannot further improve the best known solution. This scheme resembles Benders' decomposition and, in particular, the scheme underlying combinatorial Benders' cuts, but the cut generation we propose does not rely on finding an irreducible infeasible subsystem.

The VRPSPSD is a vehicle routing problem where a set of ships deliver orders (or cargo) from the depot to a set of offshore platforms and picks up return orders at the platforms destined back to the depot. Both pickup and delivery orders are selective meaning that they are not compulsory and can be left behind for a later voyage. However, this comes at a penalty cost. In the current industry practice, the VRPSPSD is planned for only one voyage and there is also only one regular vessel available. To facilitate planning, a schedule for which facilities that are visited on a specific voyage is made a priori. This ensures predictability.  However, because of uncertainty in the demand and in the reliability of the arrival of delivery orders at the depot, the capacity of the available ship could be insufficient and an additional ship needs to be chartered in. Chartering in additional ships at short notice is very expensive. In this paper we show how savings can be obtained by planning ahead and including the additional vessel in the plans from the beginning. To achieve this, a mathematical model for the VRPSPSD is presented and solved using commercial software.

A fleet of man-guided straddle carriers (SCs) is employed for container transfer during which the path between any couple of origin and destination points are determined by real-time driver decisions. The simulator embodies a multi-step decision process that mirrors the en-route behavior implemented by the SC drivers as a response to the information they receive during their trip. An event-based view, under stochastic conditions, is adopted to reproduce the point-to-point transfer process for each SC along the internal reticular paths within the Manhattan-like layout of the storage blocks in the yard. The problem tackled herein consists in estimating the number of SCs to be assigned to each quay crane involved in discharge/loading operations, while accounting for vehicle traffic, congestion and disruptions encountered by the SCs.

Solar power generation is one such option. Although solar energy is attractive, it brings new forecasting challenges. In order to integrate solar energy into the grid it is important to predict the energy supply accurately, which is dependent on solar irradiation. Large forecast errors can lead to significant costs for the operator. In this work we investigate the use of exponential smoothing to produce univariate forecasts for solar irradiation. These type of models have been explored in the past, due to their significant operational advantages as they are simple to deploy and use and do not require costly additional inputs as numerical weather models do. However, the forecasting performance of exponential smoothing has been challenged in the literature. We argue that there are two key reasons for this. First, this is due to the complex seasonal shapes exhibited in solar irradiance data. Second, conventional exponential smoothing parameter estimation is often not capable of identifying good parameters. We explore both issues by investigating the use of alternative optimisation cost functions, relaxing assumptions about the model form, in order to increase short and long term forecasting accuracy. We find that alternative cost functions have substantial benefits in terms of forecasting accuracy, data requirements and computational costs.", :title "Exponential smoothing parameter estimation for complex seasonal forms: the case solar irradiation forecasting", :keyword2 28, :authors (37220 23899), :session 406}, 1703 {:keyword1 100, :keyword3 133, :abstract "Production plants worldwide face huge challenges in satisfying high service levels and in outperforming competition.

Products are stored in the backroom for many reasons but one main factor is the limited shelf space that makes it often impossible to fit a complete replenishment order on the allocated shelf space. The design of retail backroom storage has a great impact on in-store operations, customer service levels and store life-cycle costs. Moreover, backrooms are crucial in modern retail stores to several functions, such as acting as a buffer against strong demand lifts yielded by an ever increasing promotional activity, seasonal demand peaks, and accommodating e-commerce activities. Since these warehouses are integrated in stores, they face additional challenges such as coexisting and interacting with the selling area, which also competes for both space and resources. This research aims to draw attention to the design of backroom storage areas, since most of the existing literature has focused solely on distribution centres (DC). Despite having similar functions, backroom storage facilities have particularities that deserve a distinct analysis.

Supply chain contract is a coordination mechanism that provides incentives to all of its members so that the decentralized supply chain behaves as the integrated one.

The proposed contract for supply chain coordination with price-dependent stochastic demand has desirable features. The supply chain is fully coordinated. Flexibility to allow any division of the supply chain’s profit is managed by the selected parameter in the setting of the wholesale price and the buyback price.

Our approach extends the joint replenishment problem with time-varying deterministic demand by a stochastic distribution-free solution approach that optimizes based on multiple historical replications of the target time horizon (e.g. several weeks). By doing so, we include the non-stationary stochastic demand prevalent in retail and use ”Big Data” as direct input for optimization. We introduce a mixed integer linear program and to reduce complexity for large-scale instances, perform a hierarchical decomposition, where the first-stage problem creates delivery patterns and the second-stage problem assigns patterns to products and stores and determines order-up-to levels. For the pattern creation problem we introduce decomposition approaches and a genetic algorithm. In a numerical study, we first compare the approaches on randomly created instances against the classic JRPDD on expected demand values. Results show that costs are cut on average by 2-14 %. We also apply the decomposition approaches on point-of-sales data of the European retailer, where a cost benefit of up to 25 % is achieved.", :title "Data-driven Assignment of Delivery Patterns with Handling Effort Considerations in Retail", :keyword2 169, :authors (47101 9112), :session 579}, 1722 {:keyword1 38, :keyword3 75, :abstract "One of the mayor aspects and problems of dealing with the production planning at a sawmill is the divergent production structure from heterogeneous raw material to products.

Introduction and problem description\r\nThe Power Plant Preventive Maintenance Scheduling Problem (PPPMSP) requires determining the period for which generating units of an electric power system should be taken offline for planned preventive maintenance over a time horizon. The research performed here encompasses a wide range of power plants: thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric, and wind power plants. \r\n\r\n2. Model formulation and methodology\r\nThe PPPMSP is a complex optimization problem. Objectives such as total cost minimization and consecution of a certain reliability level are proposed by imposing an objective function and satisfying a set of constraints. This problem is categorized as a 0/1 mixed integer linear programming problem. Its resolution involves the use of an optimiser.  \r\n\r\n3. Application example and findings\r\nAn example based on a high-dimensioned realistic power system was undertaken to validate the model. The findings demonstrate that the model works correctly. \r\n\r\n4. Conclusions \r\na) Several costs are integrated.\r\nb) Different power plants were considered.\r\nc) A wide variety of constraints is included.\r\nd) The results could be useful if they are applied to other realistic cases.\r\n\r\n5.

Due to the high number of influences on rail capacity – passenger and freight trains as well as construction sites –, timetable optimization in the railway network cannot be efficiently handled with manual effort. For a timetable-based development of railway infrastructure, freight train paths are optimized based on a future operating program for passenger trains to detect bottlenecks in the infrastructure.  Rail freight train paths are optimized on predefined tracks, called construction parts, which have many mutual dependencies through the use of the same infrastructure due to the highly intermeshed German railway network. For that reason the planning problem gets significantly more complicated and is too hard to be solved to optimality with manual effort. In this work, a novel approach for optimized planning of rail freight train paths will be presented and discussed. The approach combines automated periodic timetabling, optimized train path assignment and an innovative extended PESP model in the optimization process and produces either a valid rail freight timetable or a source for infeasibility, which is interpretable for a timetabling professional.", :title "A novel approach for optimized planning of rail freight train paths with intersecting traffic flows", :keyword2 151, :authors (33365 33448), :session 333}, 1748 {:keyword1 68, :keyword3 144, :abstract "We introduce a new formulation for the tactical planning problem facing container shipping companies of selecting the best subset of sailing routes from a given pool of candidate routes so as to maximize profit.

Our multi-layer multi-commodity model associates one commodity with each container origin port, and decides the route for each commodity on a logical network layer whose arcs represent segments (pairs of ports between which a container can use a single service).  This approach, combined with commodity flow variables that are indexed by segment sequence permits us to incorporate the transshipment limits while also tracking the commodity’s outflow from the system at various individual destinations.  We model the service selection and capacity constraints at the physical layer by allocating the total flow on each segment to various chosen services that can transport the loads on the segment, subject to service capacity constraints.  These modeling strategies yield a model that is smaller and easier to solve than a disaggregated multi-commodity model with transshipment limits.

Still, while some humanitarian programs are underfunded, others raise so many donations that they are overfunded.\r\nIn this paper, using multiple regression analysis, we aim to shed more light on the operational implications of fundraising and on the possible improvement of fundraising for operational expenditures for humanitarian programs. Firstly, the paper analyzes how IHOs decide on the operational expenditures included in budget appeals. Secondly, we study whether some operational expenditures require higher fundraising efforts than others. Thirdly, we estimate the responsiveness of donations to a number of variables including fundraising cost, budget appeal and area/country where the program takes place to help IHOs improve their fundraising strategies. Finally, we analyze the drivers of the actual operational expenditures made by the IHOs and look at what drives the gap between the budgeted and the actual operational expenditures.

The pipeline schedule is built one batch at the time. A batch is started by tentatively allocating the delivery that has a minimum latest start time to its latest start time slot.

A challenge hindering the intensified use of forest residues for energy production is the highly dispersed nature of the feedstock and the associated costs of collection and transport to the power plant. This work explores the potential for cost reductions through three different pre-treatment technologies: (1) pelletization, (2) torrefaction combined with pelletization and (3) fast pyrolysis. For this analysis we present a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The MILP represents decisions regarding the optimal number, locations, technologies and capacities of pre-treatment plants and the amounts of feedstock and final products to be transported between the selected locations. It minimizes the objective function of overall costs for the entire supply chain from the recovery of forest residues to the distribution of final products. The model is applied to a case study in four Chilean regions which form the centre of the Chilean forestry industry and feature a high potential of currently unexploited forest residues that could alleviate the dependency of Chile on imported fossil fuels. The assessment concludes that it is possible to provide forest fuels at delivered costs of about 6€/GJ for torrefied pellets and 9€/GJ for bio-slurry.

However, it may require much time and suffer higher cost to repair a failed unit or to replace it with a new one, so that it is necessary to replace the unit preventively before failures. In order to replace an operating unit preventively that is running successive works with cycle times, this paper proposes a new replacement policy called as undertime replacement. We have modeled overtime replacement in which the policy is done at the first completion of some working cycle over a planned time T; however, the case for opportunistic replacement when the last cycle of successive works competes before time T has not been considered.

For a given Lagrangian multiplier vector, an optimal solution of the Lagrangian relaxation problem can be obtained by checking the sign of coefficients, but it is hard to compute all the coefficients of variables.

This phenomenon bears costly implications on the firms in the supply chain, and thus has been at the topic of numerous studies. Even though a vast body of literature has been dedicated to alleviating it, a much smaller effort has been placed in quantifying it. We proposes a new measurement to gauge the bullwhip effect, after highlighting the possible flaws of the current ones. Indeed, establishing adequate measures proves to be crucial in evaluating any contribution to dampen the Bullwhip Effect. The most pervasive metric employed is the ratio of variance, which consists of computing the ratio of variance of order placed over the variance of the demand at each node. Despite its ubiquity, this measure fails to serve its purpose on several occasions, such as in the case of seasonal demand, which is frequently encountered in real life. It also penalizes promotions, which appear as outliers, another driver of the Bullwhip Effect. An additional issue associated with this measurement is the nature of the costs that the metric ought to reflect. The fluctuations of the demand variability does not translate directly into the possible costs that can be incurred, nor does it assess the performance of the supply chain as a whole. This paper will investigate potential caveats and costs of the ratio of variance metric before introducing a new measure.", :title "Re-evaluating the bullwhip effect measurement: what are we capturing?", :keyword2 152, :authors (47735 37220 38812), :session 401}, 1992 {:keyword1 100, :keyword3 141, :abstract "Strategic planning of municipal governments, as well as unstructured problems, presents complexity due to multiple actors, conflicting views and uncertainties.

Undoubtedly, the urgent need to tackle this situation is to improve health service performance in hospitals. All operations related to the health service performance in hospitals are limited in terms of capacity. Therefore, in order to fulfill the patients' demand for health care, the hospitals management should have a plan for the capacity of the operation. In hospitals, capacity planning is concerned with making sure of balancing the quality of health care delivered with the cost of providing that care. Such planning involves predicting the quantity and particular attributes of resources required to deliver health care service at specified levels of cost and quality. The fundamental measure of hospital capacity planning is the number of inpatient beds accordingly the number of doctors and the number of nurses.

Although it is intuitive that aligning the forecasting objective with the optimisation cost function is beneficial, we propose a statistically justified theoretical rationale to do this. We also demonstrate the difference between the traditional multi-steps-ahead objective function and the objective function obtained from the proposed trace likelihood function. In addition it has been argued in the literature that in the absence of a true model, it is preferable to use an extended likelihood, using multiple steps-ahead forecast error. We extend this finding by proving that maximising multi-steps-ahead likelihood is equivalent to single-step-ahead optimisation with parameter shrinkage. Therefore, maximising the proposed likelihood both incorporates the forecasting objective in the estimation and overcomes estimation limitations due to sampling or model form. We validate our theoretical findings by conducting experiments on real data and showing the advantage of the proposed approach in comparison to the standard likelihood function maximization.", :title "Trace likelihood and shrinkage in estimation of the forecasting models", :keyword2 99, :authors (47736 37220), :session 403}, 1997 {:keyword1 28, :keyword3 133, :abstract "This paper analyzes valuation and pricing of physical electricity delivery contracts.

To overcome these drawbacks, some multi-objective SVMs have been introduced. By solving large- scale second-order cone programs (SOCPs), these multi-objective SVMs give us weakly Pareto-optimal solutions.

We characterize the Pareto-optimal solutions of PM based on the optimal solution of a quadratic program (QP). When there are many classes to classify, we can easily get the Pareto-optimal solutions of PM because the QP can be decomposed into smaller QPs. Our experiments indicate that PM gives us the best classification accuracies and least training time compared with other approaches. In addition, we use some Pareto compliant indicators to evaluate the approximation performances of the multi-objective approaches.

This project details the complexities and constraints of the patrol officers’ work pattern. The aim is to provide a general framework for workforce management in the service system. Queuing theory as the theoretical basis is applied for the system initialisation. Discrete optimisation via simulation is incorporated to guide the improvement of the stochastic system performance, especially to determine the staff levels based on the numbers of incidents requiring immediate responses.

A hyper-heuristic algorithm operates on a set of low level heuristics, rather than on a direct representation of the problem. We proposed a unified encoding of a solution for different problems and a set of low level heuristics which are domain-independent and which change the solution itself. This approach enables to solve NP-hard problems giving good approximate solution in a reasonable time without a large amount of additional work required to tailor search methodologies for other problems in hand. In particular, we focused on solving DNA sequencing by hybrydization problem which is known to be strongly NP-hard.

CAs allow bidders to better express their preferences compared to traditional auction formats, where bidders place bids on individual items only. The principal motivation for using CAs is the presence of complementarities or substitution effects, which can differ among the bidders. CAs have been used for applications varying from the procurement of freight transportation services (Ledyard et al., 2002), to bus routes (Kennedy, 1995) and allocating spectrum rights (McMillan, 1994). \r\nWe consider an auction of similar goods that can be arranged in rows. An application of this setting is the selling of tickets for seats in a grandstand or stadium. Another application is selling pieces of land. Bidders can submit bids, but the subset of the goods they place a bid on has to be connected. Of course every good can only be sold once. The objective is to solve the winner determination problem (WDP). In general, the WDP is NP-hard. However, our problem has a geometric-based structure. Rothkopf et al.

For this reason, we propose a method called NEMO-IICh that adapts to the complexity of user’s preferences in the course of successive generations.

We show that this game is balanced, hence the subcontractors cooperate if an appropriate profit sharing scheme is adopted. We derive such a scheme by solving a linear program.

The network has to fulfil given features and restrictions while being optimal in certain criteria. Features are data flows between certain units, and full reliability and redundancy of the network. A network is fully reliable if the probability of the network failing any given function has to be less than a fixed safety threshold and full redundancy means that no single failure should lead to the loss of any given function. Restrictions can for example be connection requirements between certain units or certain unit placement restrictions in the specified space. Optimality criteria can be as easy as the weight and the cost of the network or can be extended to include the energy consumption and response time of the network. The problem of designing the network is then to decide where to locate the units while fulfilling all needed features and restrictions. Our approach to the problem is to view the given pre-defined space as a digraph where the nodes are possible positions for the units of the network and the edges are possible cable connections. The problem can then be formulated as a unit location problem which has to fulfil given flows with multiple start and end nodes, full reliability, full redundancy constraints and can be optimized over different objectives.

A mounting shortage of resources as well as volatile raw material prices (commodity prices and availability risks) make it extremely difficult to secure a stable supply of production inputs to the supply chain. These challenges can be mitigated by closing the loop of forward and reverse supply chains, i.e. considering flows of new and returned products simultaneously. Since the use of recycled materials is of increasing importance in modern production economies from an economic, ecological and social point of view, the integration of these inputs in existing production systems is of utmost importance. The use of secondary materials, though, is challenging due to the fact that product return rates are highly volatile (demand and yield uncertainty). Options for sustainable actions with respect to the efficient and effective recycling of secondary raw materials are shown. In this talk, an overview of the application of dual sourcing strategies in the context of supply chain management as well as other possibilities for substitution on the component and/or material level are proposed depending on an up-to-date review of academic and practitioner literature on supply chain strategies and practices for integrating dual sourcing and recycling options.", :title "Integrating dual sourcing and recycling options for critical materials", :keyword2 101, :authors (37248), :session 350}, 2178 {:keyword1 96, :keyword3 45, :abstract "In the Chilean public health system patients who need to see a medical specialist must ask for an appointment in their assigned hospital. Unfortunately, there are several hospitals that have very long waiting lists. The time needed to wait to see a specialist in many cases is excessively long. The hospital needs to schedule appointments for two main types of patients, those that come for the first time to see the specialist and those that need to be controlled. Both can be assumed to arrive randomly over time. Patients also have different priorities, depending on their medical diagnosis. Some need to see the specialist very soon, others can wait longer. Given the long waiting times, it is important to make sure high priority patients are scheduled so they can see the specialist in the required time. However, since is also important to insure fair access to the specialists for all patients, we propose a scheduling system that reserves a portion of the time slots to high priority patients leaving the rest for the regular patients, both new and control. If these slots are not assigned after a certain date, they are available to the other types of patients.

We modify these iterations to allow for a state previously eliminated to be 'reinserted' into the state space in one iteration. This modification sheds a new light on the relationship between an initial and censored MC, and introduces a new operation, which we call 'insertion', into the theory of MCs. This operation is used to obtain an algorithmic solution to the new class of applied probability models, where at each moment of a discrete time a decision maker can apply one of three possible actions - continue, quit and restart the MC in one of a finite number of fixed 'restarting' points. Such a model is a generalization of a model of Katehakis and Veinott (1987), where a restart to a unique point was allowed without any fee and quit action was absent.

Mostly, the main cost considered in a route is taken as the pre-determined cost of travelling to the last point in that route. Stop-by costs, which can be defined as costs taking place when a vehicle goes to the points between the depot and the last point, and deviation cost should be added to reach total cost.  Deviation cost can be thought as the extra distance travelled in a route compared to the distance taken directly from the depot to the last point of that route. When we consider last point costs, stopping-by costs and deviation costs as the main costs in OVRP models, more reasonable and realistic solutions can be obtained.

Extensive coordination among these stages in the supply chain is necessary for a high performing overall system. Integrating production and distribution operations can result in lower costs and a better service level. To integrate these two functions the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) needs to be extended with production issues. An overview of the scarce literature on this topic will be provided.

At the operational decision level, the machine scheduling problem needs to be incorporated.

One of the suggestions to overcome this problem is that carmakers retain ownership of batteries and provide service stations in which customers replace their depleted batteries with recharged batteries in lieu of waiting for their battery to recharge. Motivated by this approach, we consider spare allocation in an exchangeable-item multi-location repair system with Poisson arrivals and ample servers with general repair time distribution. Customers expect to be served within a certain time window and penalize the service provider if they have to wait more than that window of time. Accordingly, instead of minimizing average waiting time, we suggest that firms should consider maximizing the fill rate window, i.e. the probability that customers wait less than a predetermined time window. We derive the entire system’s fill rate window for any time window, and characterize its functional form. For each location the fill rate window can be either concave or S-shaped.

Each required edge has an assigned demand, and the sum of demands covered in each route must not exceed the amount called capacity. This problem arises in various situations including waste collection, street sweeping and winter gritting. Recently, attention has been given to a variant of the CARP called the Split Delivery Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (SDCARP) where split deliveries are allowed; in other words, required edges may be covered by more than one route (or “serviced by more than one vehicle”). It is hoped that split deliveries can reduce the total cost as vehicles are no longer forced to service an edge fully, and so they can service some edges even if its remaining capacity is smaller than the remaining demand of any required edge. In addition to a smaller total cost, this could mean that fewer vehicles/routes are needed. Introduced by Golden and Wong in 1981, the CARP is NP-hard and, as a generalisation of the CARP, so is the SDCARP. This suggests the need for heuristic algorithms that can find “good” solutions in reasonable time.

Dynamism refers to evolving preferences due to interactions between agents in the network. The context-awareness, instead, is the knowledge background that the agents take into account in doing their decisions. The evolution of a network will consequently depend on three factors: its initial configuration, the inclination of each agent to be influenced by the other agents in the network and the variability of the context-awareness. Depending on these three factors, the network could oscillate between several configurations or it can move to a fixed configuration that will not be modified anymore. \r\nIn this new social perspective of multiple criteria decision making, the behaviour of each agent is represented by different parameters whose variation determines the evolution of the network.

Delays can for example be managed by adding buffer times in the timetables (prevention) or by increasing the sailing speed of the ship (recovery). Our goal is to jointly optimize the buffer times and sailing speed. Buffer time allocation is a problem on the tactical planning level, which has to be made in the scheduling problem before routes are executed. Adjusting the sailing speed, on the contrary, is a decision on the operational planning level. Hence, the optimal sailing times given a buffer allocation should already be available when determining the quality of the given buffer allocation, while in practice these decisions are taken much later. In our solution approach, we use that the optimal cost associated with a fixed buffer allocation can be obtained by solving a finite state Markov Decision Process and is convex in the buffer allocation.

In the context of location decisions and supply network design, sustainability imposes that any development and design decision in location planning must also consider social and environmental aspects. This research extends the existing facility location literature by integrating environmental and social sustainability concerns with the classical location decision problem. For that purpose, initially, environmental and social sustainability objectives for location decisions are identified and the associated measures are quantified. Then, a multi-objective optimisation model is built to support location decisions, deriving the Pareto solutions given a location decision problem. The novelty of this research is that it incorporates sustainability dimensions explicitly in the location decision: where to locate a recollection facility so that its negative impact on the environment (CO2, water, ecosystem, resources) is minimised and its positive impact on the society (employment, education, welfare, health) is maximised in addition to the objective of minimising transportation and investment costs.", :title "Location Decisions for Supply Chain Sustainability", :keyword2 63, :authors (29552), :session 351}, 2442 {:keyword1 86, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In the context of how to handle uncertainties in projects, most of the OR textbooks still comprise a chapter about PERT. But unfortunately, it can easily be shown that the whole PERT approach systematically underestimates the real risk. Besides this, the PERT approach suggests and supports a fallacious and in a lot of cases simply wrong understanding of the underlying situation. The reason for this is mainly because PERT starts with the creation of a critical path, which assumes a strictly deterministic model, and then – like putting the cherry on the cake – just adds a few stochastic elements. \r\nBut if you accept uncertainties, you get a total change in paradigm, because then everything becomes stochastic, let it be durations, buffers, dates of start and end of the activities etc. and even the critical path becomes a random variable. On the first sight this seems to be more complex than PERT, but the stochastic approach offers the opportunity to apply a lot of (uni- and multivariate) statistical tools.\r\nIt is possible to analyse all these random variables to get for instance an impression of the real “criticality” of the individual activities of the project and their correlations, their distributions etc. By this you get the opportunity to get a deeper insight into the real structure and dynamics of the project. \r\nThe proposed contribution to the conference tries to show how to overcome the inappropriate PERT approach by means of Monte Carlo simulation. \r\n", :title "Scheduling in Projects in Consideration of Uncertainties", :keyword2 0, :authors (30668), :session 429}, 2444 {:keyword1 150, :keyword3 178, :abstract "\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method (LR) as an alternative way for the partitioning of a giant tour.

PVRP is based on visiting customers once or more during a planning horizon with multiple days. The problem decides the customers to be visited and the routes for each day. In general, the goal is to minimize the total length of the routes. Organizing the visit days properly provides an important advantage to decrease delivery costs and the number of vehicles. Our problem involves two types of visits that must be on consecutive days in PVRP setting. The first type visit to the customer is for collecting demand information and increasing the visibility of the products at the store, whereas the second customer visit is for delivering the goods. The first type visits take place with small and fast vehicles under time capacity constraints. On the other hand, the second type visits require relatively large scale, slow and physical capacitated vehicles. Hence using the same routes for the consecutive days might not be feasible.

In this article, however, we show that these results are no longer valid under uncertainty, if companies do not only decide about the size of a renewable electricity project, but also have the flexibility to wait with the investment into the project. In particular, under uncertainty the investor’s flexibility may lead to an optimal capacity of the project that does not depend on governmental support. Furthermore, decreasing fixed feed-in tariffs as well as higher uncertainty may - due to a lower option effect - lead to higher capacities of renewables installed on a macroeconomic level, at least on the short-run.", :title "The Paradox Effects of Uncertainty and Flexibility on Investment in Renewables under Governmental Support", :keyword2 7, :authors (33689), :session 881}, 2537 {:keyword1 169, :keyword3 124, :abstract "We present a new feature selection algorithm to extract multiple and locally adjacent solutions for supervised machine learning problems applied to sequenced data.

Many techniques and methodologies have been developed to solve them or at least to find acceptable solutions. A number of approaches raise from different fields, mainly operations research, artificial intelligence or applied mathematics.\r\nAlthough the state-of-the-art solutions for a given specific COP are usually very good, they lack the flexibility to easily adapt to variations of the same problem. This happens even more in solutions based on meta-heuristics, since they do not explicitly contain the model of the problem. A change normally implies re-tuning the parameters to fit the new problem. Thus, for instance, given a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), extremely good quick solutions are found with meta-heuristics. But the inclusion of a new temporal constraint (moving to a CVRP with Time Windows), implies solving a completely different problem which will require re-tuning all the parameters.\r\nIn this paper, we provide the initial steps of a flexible hybrid methodology which combines Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Constraint Programming (CP), to quickly adapt to changing COPs.

Rich VRPs are highly evaluated in practice, since ignoring restrictions are very costly for at least two reasons. First, infeasible routes require (manual) rework. Second, more sound models lead to better evaluations of (intermediate) VRP solutions and therefore give better direction in the search for good VRP solutions. This better guidance for good VRP solutions often outweighs the extra calculation time needed for evaluating VRP solutions.

It is well known that the non-overlapping inequalities considerably increase the difficulty of solving these models. Therefore, we explore two alternative ways to formulate the non-overlapping constraints that permit a given set of orientations of the pieces. The first model uses the nofit polygons to write the non-overlapping inequalities and introduce binary variables to select the orientation used by the pieces. In the second model we introduce a new use of the nofit polygon in which different nofit polygons are combined, leading to more promising models.

The proposed methodology aims at minimizing the global interaction between aircraft trajectories by allocating alternative departure times, alternative horizontal flight paths, and alternative flight levels to the trajectories involved in the interaction. To improve robustness of the strategic trajectory planning, uncertainty of aircraft position and aircraft arrival time to any given position on the trajectory are considered. We propose a mathematical formulation of this strategic trajectory planning problem leading to a discrete-optimization and a mixed-integer optimization problem whose objective function  relies on the new concept of interaction between trajectories.

One main result of the simulation model is the hourly dispatch of generation and storage units for a consecutive year. The application of the model for three different scenarios of the European energy system in 2050 shows the influence of flexibilities on the use of PtG storages.

However, entry-exit tariffs only give aggregated information about the network to suppliers, which do not reflect the costs of the TSO in detail. While this is intended at enhancing liquidity, this decoupling between physical and economic gas flows might reduce the efficiency of the overall gas system.

Thus, the ex-post locational incentives provided by those tariffs are never properly assessed. In order to analyze the real efficiency of entry-exit tariffs, we define them as the result of an equilibrium problem between profit-maximizing suppliers that choose gas sources and a cost-minimizing TSO that operates the network to satisfy suppliers' nominations.

Pollution is regarded as being a predator-type variable, since it would (nearly) disappear in absence of people driving cars and/or needing housing facilities; pollution increases with the demand for mobility and housing services. By applying optimal control theory to our predator-prey type model of UED we seek to understand the effect of management decisions like implementing or delaying pollution control or behavioral measures on both residential density and the level of environmental pollution.

We describe a stochastic planning engine (Wind­hydro Integration Stochastics Engine ­WhISE) developed jointly by IBM Research and IREQ, the research division of Hydro-Québec. WhISE generates a day-ahead unit commitment plan for hydro-turbines and helps decide the optimal dispatch of the hydro capacity to meet per-hour demand such that the expected end-of-day value of an overall operational performance metric is minimized. WhISE takes historical demand and wind realizations as input, creates a forecast model based on dynamic linear modeling. A set of scenarios (sample paths through time) of possible realizations of renewable generation are then sampled from this forecast model. A key innovation is the day-ahead planning and multi-period dispatch problem in WhISE, which is modeled using a two­stage stochastic programming formulation. The first stage makes decisions that set the turbine commitments for each hour of the next day. The second stage models the realized turbine commitments and arc flows by choosing optimal values from within the range of allowed operation of the committed turbines.", :title "Wind-hydro Integration Stochastics Engine (WhISE)", :keyword2 85, :authors (41717 39205), :session 779}, 2884 {:keyword1 14, :keyword3 66, :abstract "The concept of criticality is one of the basic concepts of the variational\r\nanalysis.

Empirical research indicates that the sales of innovations typically follow a product life cycle in many industries. Due to cash flows which depend on uncertain future market conditions as well as high investment expenditures, the company has to decide carefully how much capacity it wants to provide for the production. This paper studies the effect of uncertainty on the decision to invest in production capacity for traction batteries for electric vehicles, taking into account the combined effects of flexible investment timing and product life cycle depended sales commonly neglected in the finance and operations research literature. The drift parameter of a geometric Brownian motion is parameterized to an uncertain product life cycle. The investment option is valued numerically with the Crank-Nicholson method.

Through this system, all qualifications for higher education and other learning outcomes can be explained and related to each other consistently. (Turkey Higher Education Council). The performance evaluation of the departments (it also means macro point” universities”) in terms of educational management is a complex process, in which multiple criteria are required to be considered simultaneously. To achieve this point, it is considered a fact that selecting and weighting education metrics are essential. Subjectivity is generally considered as the main problem for multi criteria decision aid techniques. Dispelling this point, different outranking techniques are used (Entropy, Protmethee I-II, Electe, Topsis, Vicor) in this study.

However, the transition function is not known perfectly (structural uncertainty). It will be demonstrated that solving the MDP for different possible transition functions leads to significantly different optimal policies resulting in earlier or later infection of the Australian mainland.

To find the right balance between availability and stocking costs is often very challenging due to the special characteristics of spare parts demand. That is, spare parts demand is typically slow-moving, highly stochastic, erratic and lumpy.  In particular, it has been shown by previous research that it is generally not normally distributed, and that the best fitting distribution (mostly Gamma, Negative Binomial Distribution and Stuttering Poisson) depends on the mean inter-demand interval length, and on the squared coefficient of variation of demand sizes. As most inventory policies rely on distributional assumption of the demand, a wrong hypothesized distribution may result in unnecessary stock holdings and huge blocked capitals (as spare parts are often expensive), or in high penalty costs due to unplanned stock-outs. We study the case of a worldwide leader in the wind-turbines market based in Germany. We analyze their weekly demand for spare parts in the last three years for over 4000 items.

Increasingly the Cloud Service Broker is also being used for creating compositions using granular and heterogeneous services from multiple providers to fit the needs, minimize costs, meet performance guarantees, or to mitigate risks. To meet the requirements, the broker has to determine the set of services needed, find the matching service providers, and select service providers such that the overall objective is met.

In this paper we present a translation tool for conceptual models, with the ability to reduce the “gap” that exists usually when we need to translate a conceptual model for an equivalent physical one. Throughout this article will demonstrate that it is possible to translate automatically ETL systems conceptual models (tasks, working flows, etc.) developed in BPMN into the environment of a specific ETL systems implementation tool. After a careful study of the most relevant specificities of a BPMN model specification, we choose Kettle (Pentaho Data Integration) as the tool to receive the models translated by the tool we implemented. The BPMN models were built so that they can produce schemes, simple and easy to perform, for a specific execution environment (RAID). This allowed us to demonstrate the utility of the tool in the translation, validation and generation of the correspondent physical schemas, which can be performed in Kettle. These ETL physical schemas were designated by ETL skeletons - a set of execution primitives.", :title "RAID-B2K, Transforming BPMN Conceptual Schemas into Kettle Execution Primitives", :keyword2 61, :authors (48300 48283 48312 48310 48311), :session 30}, 3094 {:keyword1 97, :keyword3 25, :abstract "The aim of this work was to retrospectively evaluate the redesign of the fracture pathway in a major NHS hospital, focusing on cost effectiveness at a micro level. \r\nThe processes contain multiple points of variation at the input and at various stages throughout, which were considered in the evaluation.  Discrete event simulation was used to model a major part of the re-design, a virtual fracture clinic, and the results compared with a model of a traditional clinic. Resource utilisation and cost was reported for each of the models. An important element of the costing was the family and patient resource or the societal cost of the re-design. This was evaluated using questionnaires to determine the number of clinic visits that patients make and the inconvenience this causes them in terms of time and out of pocket expenses.\r\nThis work shows that there are savings from implementing the fracture redesign process, at least within the test hospital and from the perspective of health board and government funding.

These moment conditions are determined by the implementation of Conic Quadratic Optimization. In order to generalize our model for the process, which has infinite number of observations, we proof that our model conditions are efficient and consistent. It is shown that consistency can be achieved through convergence of the model parameters towards the true parameters. By the help of Tikhonov regularization, we construct a minimum distance measure and identify the conditions under which convergence is achieved. Asymptotic distribution of the CQP-estimated GMM estimator is evaluated based on the variance-covariance matrix. The optimal choice of the weight matrix, which uses the maximum available information, ensures that the optimal variance-covariance matrix is identified.

Such sources of energy are usually non-dispatchable and partly predictable, so support mechanisms were put in place in order to safeguard stochastic producers against price volatility. However, as their stakes increase, electricity markets over-relying on support mechanisms also increase losses in social welfare by transferring imbalance costs to consumers. This calls for a new approach in the design of electricity markets whereby those responsible for imbalances are also accountable. \r\nIn this paper, we propose a shift from the current paradigm of treating stochastic producers similarly to the conventional ones. We argue that the producers' offers should be probabilistic, instead of deterministic, so that they reflect the stochastic nature of production and design a market mechanism to accommodate such offers. The mechanism allocates uncertainty risk proportionally to the stochastic producers, while we analytically prove that revenues  are equal to a linear transformation of a strictly proper scoring rule. This shows that the mechanism elicits accurate and precise forecasts.

The achievement of the defined goal is realized by application of 3D software technology including the following stages: an optimization synthesis based on the mathematical model upon a pitch contact point; construction of 3D software model by the application of a mathematical model for synthesis upon mesh region; an elaboration a physical prototype by 3D printing; a technical realization of gear drive by 3D printing.\r\nThe application of the 3 D technology gives a certain impetus in development of the innovation in the creation of spatial gears. The result is shortening of the cycle of the gear‘s realization; an elimination of teeth generation errors; a sharp increase of accuracy in gears manufacture and etc.\r\nIn the study solutions of some of the tasks included in the 3D technology for the creation of the physical prototypes of two class skew-axes gears of type Spiroid and Helicon are illustrated.

Two strategies are developed with one-price and two-price balancing markets separately. Both strategies are built to determine optimal offers taking into account expected wind power forecasting errors and the power balancing capability of the ESS. For the former case, a reserve-based bidding and operation strategy is modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization formulation. A modified gradient descent algorithm is designed to solve this nonlinear problem. Linear decision rules are chosen as the real-time control strategy in the latter case, as it can fully utilize past and current price and wind power information, so as to perform arbitrage. A number of case studies allow validating the proposed strategies and corresponding algorithms, in terms of computational efficiency and optimality.

In his seminal paper, Scarf proved that the optimal control policy for this problem is of (s,S)-type, where s is the reorder-point, and S is the order-up-to-level. Since demand is non-stationary and planning horizon is finite the optimal control parameters are dynamic (i.e, in the form of (st,St).

However, when side-constraints, like constraints on order quantities, are introduced most of the time the form of the optimal policy is not simple anymore and the application in practice is very limited. In this work, we adopt a neural policy to solve this well-known problem and its variants. These problems are tackled without exploiting any background information related to the structural properties of the optimal policy or the solution. We show that the neural approach proposed in this paper is very effective in tackling the original problem as well as its variants.

To handle these constraints, some existing protocols propose solutions with the use of virtual channels, routing tables, Q-learning methods and metaheuristics. These techniques generate sometimes negative impacts on the NoC performance.\r\n\r\nIn this context, a novel fully adaptive routing algorithm called HRA (Heuristic Routing Algorithm) is developed. It uses a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm to find a local optimal neighbor at each hop until reaching the destination node. VNS is mainly based on a local search strategy represented there by the A* (A Star) heuristic based search method. The advantage of using heuristics is a prediction of the best optimal path according to the network state.

The norm can be arbitrary. Our main result is the existence of an optimal line for the median line location problem with demand sets which is tangent to at least two of the demand sets if a mild general position assumption on the demand sets holds. This gives rise to a simple solution technique running in cubic time with respect to the number of demand sets. The general position assumption can be removed without compromising the running time. Furthermore, we show that convexity of the demand sets can be relaxed to connectedness and even unconnected demand sets can be handled within a running time cubic in the total number of connected components of all demand sets.

The framework is tested upon twelve geographical datasets in the Danish railway network.

The uncertain data are handled in the objective functions by means of robust optimization. Thus, the problem is referred as bi-objective Robust Vehicle Routing (bi-RVRP) and it is defined on a complete digraph with a set of vertices representing the customers and depot, and a set of arcs corresponding to the network transportation. Uncertain data for travel times are modeled as a set of discrete scenarios, where a scenario specifies an assignation of costs to every arc. Moreover, an expected demand is associated with each customer and uncertainties over the demands are modeled as an interval, which represent the deviation from the expected values. A fleet of identical vehicles with a fixed capacity is available at the depot.  The problem consists in defining a set of routes starting and ending at the depot, visiting each customer once and respecting vehicle capacities. The goal is to minimize simultaneously the worst total travel times over all the scenarios and the maximum total unmet demands over a bounded set of scenarios. The bi-RVRP finds applications in urban transportation. We propose multi-objective metaheuristics based on evolutionary algorithms such as NSGAII and MOEA.

The use of Tcl/Tk gives MagLab an advantage over existing packages by providing true cross platform compatibility, requiring only a Tcl/Tk interpreter per platform and removing the need for code recompilation. The interpreter is royalty free, which removes licensing issues (traditionally found with cross-platform applications) and allows MagLab to be provided in a run-from-disk format with no installation required.

Consequently, the interplay of generated surpluses and shortfalls as well as limited storage possibilities complicate proper scheduling of renewable energy generation. Moreover, renewable energy technology comes along with high investment costs that strongly restrict their profitability. While these high costs decline after some time in operation due to increasing experience and know-how, the planning horizon typically is too short to take these learning effects into account, implying that investments for renewable energy technologies are often postponed into the future, which strongly restricts the scope of renewable energy generation.

We find that (i) the revenue sharing contract circumvents the double marginalization effect associated with vertical competition and therefore yields the best selling price for the customer; (ii) a decentralized supply chain sometimes performs better than a centralized one; and (iii) a risk-seeking developer may obtain a higher expected profit than does a risk-neutral developer.\r\n", :title "Consignment Contract in a Supply Chain of Mobile Applications under Risk Consideration", :keyword2 40, :authors (48531 48524 48846), :session 504}, 3358 {:keyword1 152, :keyword3 0, :abstract "For effective management of industrial or commercial enterprise using a resource with limited period of validity it is necessary to have reliable appraisals of basic characteristics of casual process of employing this resource.

We consider constant-time testability of properties on scale-free networks. A graph property is a (possibly infinite) family of graphs, which is closed under isomorphism.  A a tester for a property accepts an input graph if it has the property and rejects it if it's far from having the property in high probability (e.g., at least 2/3) by reading a constant part of the input. A property is said to be testable if there is a tester. We introduce a natural class of (multi)graphs, Hierarchical Scale-Free Multigraphs (HSF, in short) for modeling real scale-free networks, and consider constant-time testability on the class. We first show that multigraphs in HSF is hyperfinite.  For positive real numbers t and eps, a graph consisting of n vertices is (t,eps)-hyperfinite if one can remove at most eps n edges from the graph and obtained a graph whose connected components have size at most t.  It has been known that every property is testable on the class of hyperfinete graphs with degreee bounded by a constant by Newman and Sohler in STOC11.  While HSF is not degreee bounded by a constant, we can also construct a universal tester for HSF by using the hyperfineteness, i.e., we get the following result: Every property on the class of scale-free multi-graphs is testable.

The requester then aggregates the reported outputs to obtain a collective output. A crucial question that arises during this process is: how many crowd workers should a requester hire? In this work, we investigate the optimal number of workers a requester should hire on the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. In particular, we report the results of three studies involving different tasks as well as different payment schemes. We find that both the expected error in the aggregate output as well as the risk of a poor combination of workers decrease as the number of workers increases. Surprisingly, we find that the optimal number of workers a requester should hire for each task is around 10 to 11, no matter the underlying task and payment scheme. To derive such a result, we employ a principled analysis based on segmented linear regression. Besides the above result, we also find that top-performing workers are more consistent across multiple tasks than worst-performing workers.

A single firm for example, does provide higher greening levels but it is less than what is socially desirable. Further, greening costs do restrict firms from going green. As observed in practice, we verify that under competition, the firm with lower cost of greening has a better advantage in providing higher greening levels under government taxation. Additionally, under higher government penalty, a firm with a lower greening cost will offer higher product greening level than its competitor, in turn benefitting significantly in a green conscious consumer market. The results have interesting implications for policy makers as well.

We focus in this study on the manufacturing of a set of vias that connect components from two consecutive layers. One of the basic steps in this process is Lithography.  Lithography imposes a certain minimum distance for two vias to be printed simultaneously. Hence dense layouts are decomposed into feasible sub layouts (a.k.a. masks) that will be printed sequentially to produce the original arrangement: this is called Multiple Patterning (MP). Each lithography step is costly and the goal is thus to minimize the number of masks in this decomposition. This problem can readily be modeled as a graph-coloring problem in unit disk graphs (a NP-hard problem) and a number of good heuristics exist. Directed self-assembly (DSA) is a promising solution to reduce further the number of masks. The idea is to group vias that have to be assigned to different masks in MP to a same mask combining DSA and Lithography. The main challenge of our study is to find the best way of grouping vias (following imposed rules) in order to minimize the number of `hybrid' masks.

In addition, a dynamic programming algorithm that runs is pseudo-polynomial time and polynomial greedy heuristics are implemented and computationally compared with ILP/CP approaches. For the computational study, a large set of knapsack-type instances with various characteristics is used to examine the applicability and strength of the proposed approaches.\r\n", :title "ILP Formulations for the Lazy Bureaucrat Problem", :keyword2 176, :authors (22042 25257 36277), :session 737}, 3527 {:keyword1 63, :keyword3 29, :abstract "This paper aims to provide knowledge to assist stakeholders in developing countries to understand the impacts of the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into the conventional network giving birth to a smart energy grid.

As the identification of suitable network weights is of preeminent importance in learning the classification or regression task at hand from a given dataset, a number of methodologies have been proposed to aid the learning process in setting initial starting weights. In addition to the standard procedure, using starting values drawn at random from a uniform distribution constrained to a narrow interval around zero, e.g. [-0.5; 0.5], a number of alternative initialisation methodologies have been proposed by Nguyen-Widrow, Drago-Ridella, Wessels-Barnard, and LeCun, which promise enhanced learning accuracy, efficiency and / or robustness. However, although these techniques have been evaluated on classification tasks for multilayer perceptrons, they have not yet been assessed on tasks of time series prediction and forecasting.

First, networks are commonly large and heterogeneous which brings the necessity for detailed information from all parts of the network.  Second, information on suppliers is often commercially sensitive and large parts of the network will remain invisible to an observer. Here we utilize the method of generalized modelling to approach this contradiction and to reveal determinants of stability in complex supply networks.\r\nGeneralized modelling is a technique introduced in ecological systems and entails the assumption of continuous time flows across an integrated network. The method postulates a steady state situation and because interdependencies of production, supply and information flow on the network are unknown, the method assumes general functional forms. The key is to parameterise potential interdependencies between functions and variables based solely on the topology of the network. Application of the method reveals factors that increase or decrease the system stability.

This extended formulation provides for all evaluated topologies stronger linear programming lower bounds than the base formulation. However, this formulation still suffers from the large size of the resulting variables and constraints sets; hence, solving the linear relaxation of the problem becomes intractable when the network size increases.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we investigate different computational strategies to overcome the computational limits of the formulations.

The shift from 2-1-0 to 3-1-0 changes the scoring structure from balanced to imbalanced, as game points for a win in the latter is higher than the shared spoils for a tied result. The 3-1-0: 3-2-0 structure is balanced too, as is breaking a draw by other means and assigning two points and one point to the winning and losing teams, respectively. Penalty shout-outs are used to break tied outcomes in knock-out games, and their proposed use in league competition would also serve teams well in future international competition.

When uncertainty can be captured by a finite set of scenarios that occur according to some known probability distribution, the extensive form of the deterministic equivalent can be derived leading to a mixed integer programming model that can be enhanced using several sets of valid inequalities. A series of computational tests was performed using a state-of-the-art solver for tackling different instances of the problem that were generated from the well-known CAB data set.

The likelihood of a correct diagnosis can be increased by carrying out diagnostic tests. However, because such tests are not totally reliable and consume resources, they should only be carried out if the increase in utility resulting from making a better-informed treatment decision can be expected to offset the costs of testing. In this paper, we present a decision-analytic framework for identifying cost-effective testing strategies. In particular, depending on the patient's initial probability of having a disease, our framework helps determine (i) which tests to carry out and in which order and, given the test results so far, (ii) when to stop testing and decide on a treatment action. The problem of finding an optimal testing strategy is modeled as a decision tree in which the probability of a patient having a disease is updated based on the test results using Bayesian methods. We show how the optimal testing strategy (i.e. the optimal path through the tree) can be solved with a reasonable computational effort using a dynamic programming algorithm. Besides identifying optimal testing strategies, we discuss how our framework can be used to support the cost-effectiveness analyses of adopting new testing technologies.", :title "A decision-analytic framework for the identification of cost-effective diagnostic testing strategies", :keyword2 167, :authors (2268 46156 23949), :session 219}, 3649 {:keyword1 14, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The study of matrix inequalities in a dimension-free setting is in the realm of free real algebraic geometry (RAG).

AnVIM draws on the soft systems methodology for business model mapping and value identification. Analysis of the business model is used to identify opportunities for analytics, which are classified in a matrix according to potential for value creation and viability.

Motivated by these needs, this paper aims to study how to achieve agility in sustainable supply chains by exploiting the state of the art information technologies. Our goal is to develop architecture and a method to endow actors with the ability to configure sustainable supply chain network quickly, flexibly, cost effectively and environmentally responsibly.

A novel analytical framework has been developed over several phases including: conducting focused-group interviews with stakeholders to identify variable measures on users’ concern to complement the literature; developing of online surveys to collect real-interaction data; validation of relationships among variables using structured equation-modeling to develop a Cost-Risk and Benefit-Opportunity Analysis (COBRA) framework; establishing a user’s satisfaction index using the relative ratio of the sum of the weighted multiple-impact (benefit and opportunity output and outcome) variables over the sum of the weighted multiple-input (risk and cost) variables. The frontier data envelopment analysis is then used to find the optimal weights to measure the relative efficiency of multiple-input utilization over the effectiveness of multiple-impact generation.

Similarly, it was further validated and generalized on sets of e-services in Qatar, Lebanon and UK from the perspectives of both users and providers. \r\n\r\nThe proposed framework has a number of managerial, policy and practical implications including: provision of analytical tools that determined the gaps in satisfaction among stakeholders for the first time in literature; identification of best-practice national benchmark for learning and development; generation of applied insights to reduce cost and increase take-ups; determination of effectiveness and efficiency indices to help policy makers in measuring the impact of policies on change over time and to prioritize e-services for resources allocation; easy to adopt by government agencies worldwide.", :title "A Novel Analytic Framework for Sustainable Development of Electronic Government Services from  Stakeholders’ Perspectives", :keyword2 0, :authors (15536 8227 49347 49413 47420 49359 49352 49351), :session 572}, 3691 {:keyword1 152, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We study spare parts inventory control for an aircraft component repair shop.

However, the idea of interchangeable parts was originally a maintenance innovation. Equipment that represents a significant financial investment (e.g. aircraft, rolling stock and MRI scanners) is usually maintained by replacing parts in need of maintenance with ready-for-use parts. In this manner, downtime of equipment due to maintenance can be kept to a minimum. To make this system work, it is crucial to have the right amount of spare parts available. This thesis is dedicated to questions that planners os spare part supply chains face regularly, such as: How many spare parts to buy? How to schedule overhauls of important parts? When should the repair of a spare part be expedited? To aid in making these decisions, we formulate mathematical models to gain structural insights and develop practical solution algorithms. Important features, such as multiple types of spare parts and shared capacities, are incorporated.\r\nThis research was conducted in collaboration with our industrial partner, NedTrain.

This conceals the fact that heuristics are a fundamental component of state-of-the-art global solvers for mixed integer linear programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We focus on this latter aspect and study heuristics that are tightly integrated within an MINLP solver and analyze their impact on the overall solution process.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we introduce two novel large-neighborhood search heuristics, Undercover and RENS, that are designed to be employed as start heuristics inside a global solver. Undercover explores a mixed integer *linear* subproblem of a given MINLP. Therefore, an auxiliary vertex covering problem is solved to identify a smallest set of variables to fix such that each constraint is linearized. RENS uses a sub-MINLP to exploit the set of feasible roundings of a given solution of a relaxation.\r\n\r\nWe give theoretic motivations and discuss implementation details of both approaches. Computational results assess the ability of these heuristics to find feasible solutions and their impact on the overall performance of the MINLP solver SCIP.

Among other factors, it was observed that inappropriate allocation of personnel is one of the main factors that affect the queuing situation. Therefore, an interactive framework is constructed which may assist the hospital management to quickly determine the required number of personnel at different wait times. Hence, the queuing situation is controlled pre-emptively, before wait times increase excessively.

This allows us to make cancer therapies more specific to drug resistance, or to make the process of copper extraction from mining waste more efficient and ecologically friendly.", :title "Modelling and Analysis of High-throughput Data in Cancer Research and in Microbial Ecology", :keyword2 58, :authors (48698 49487 49488 49489), :session 77}, 3738 {:keyword1 114, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This sessions reflects recent developments in OR teaching at an advanced level, such as for PhD students and Post-docs.
