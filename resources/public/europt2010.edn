That is, it should be possible to travel from any vertex to any other vertex in at most $n-d$ steps (traversing an edge at each step). The unbounded case was disproved by Klee and Walkup in 1967. In this talk I will describe the construction of the first counter-example to the bounded case (a polytope).\r\n\r\nThe conjecture was posed and is relevant in the context of the simplex method in linear programming. The simplex method, after all, finds the optimal solution by moving from vertex to vertex along the edges of the feasibility polyhedron. Experimentally, the simplex method usually finishes in a linear number of steps, but examples where certain choices of pivot rules lead to exponentially long paths exist, and no pivot rule is known that can be proved to always finishes in polynomial number of steps. Although other methods for linear programming are proved to be polynomial (Karmakar, Khachiyan), the simplex method remains one of the methods most often used in practice.\r\n\r\n From a complexity theory point of view, it is also significant that the known methods are polynomial in the \"bit complexity\" model, but a polynomial pivot rule for the simplex method would provide a \"strongly polynomial\" algorithm, that is, one that is polynomial also in the \"real machine\" model. The question whether such a \"strongly polynomial\" method exists for linear programming was included by S.  \r\nSmale in his list of \"Mathematical problems for the next century\" (AMS, 2000).

Moreover, the least squares model is based on the assumption that only the dependent variable is subject to measurement errors; the independent variables are assumed to be known exactly, a premise that is often not fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWe will present an approach that avoids these shortcomings. The basic idea is that a different criterion is chosen to be minimized for the optimal hyperplane: instead of minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, we consider the deviations for each variable and multiply them. The new estimate possesses desirable theoretical properties and comes with a nice geometrical interpretation.
