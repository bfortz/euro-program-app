The field of arc routing started with the celebrated Königsberg bridges problem in the eighteenth century but its development came mainly from 1950 and it was motivated by the variety and importance of the practical situations in which it appears, such as: garbage collection, road or street maintenance, mail delivery, etc. We will focus in this talk on the development of exact methods devised for these problems. Most of the relevant arc routing problems are NP-hard, and this fact has motivated the development of a lot of efficient heuristic and metaheuristic methods that have been successfully applied to large instances of these problems. Nevertheless, although these methods may produce near optimal solutions, they are not able to give any guarantee on the quality of the provided solutions. On the other hand, exact methods may fail in solving to optimality a given instance in a reasonable amount of computing time, but they can be used to compute tight bounds that give this guarantee. We aim to provide an overview of the main tools and procedures that have been devised to allow the exact resolution of arc routing problems, without considering similar procedures that have been applied to similar variants of the same problem. Thus, we do not try to be exhaustive, but to highlight the core of the methods that can be used to solve these problems.\r\nWe start with the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP), where a least cost route has to be found that traverses all the edges or arcs of an undirected or a directed graph, respectively. These are the only relevant arc routing problems that can be polynomially solved, and the corresponding procedures have often been used to compute tight bounds for harder arc routing problems. The same problem defined on a mixed or on a windy graph is NP-hard and both have been solved by branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut. We will review some of the formulations that have been used to solve these problems and include details on effective cuts and the corresponding separation algorithms. The Rural Postman Problem (RPP) differs from the CPP in that only a subset of arcs/edges has to be traversed. The problem is motivated by the fact that in most arc routing problems not all the arcs require service. This problem is NP-hard regardless of the type of graph where it is defined, in fact the Travelling Salesman Problem can be easily reduced to it. A rich and deep study of the polyhedron associated with the RPP has been carried out along the last twenty years, giving rise to efficient Branch-and-cut methods to solve it. Again, we will give details of the formulations, additional constraints and separation algorithms that have made it possible to solve this problem with a reasonable computing time.\r\nArc routing problems where several routes have to be constructed seem to be much harder. The reference problem here is the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem, where routes have to satisfy a capacity restriction. A great variety of methods have been proposed for this problem in the last years, including transformations into node routing problems, methods based on computing combinatorial bounds, cutting plane and branch-and-cut methods based on different integer formulations, and column generation and branch-and-price methods. Some methods basically provide lower bounds on optimal solutions. They have to be complemented with good (meta)heuristics for computing solutions and upper bounds that in some cases close the optimality gap and so provide a proof of optimality. The other methods presented here are all variants of branch-and-bound. Despite of the efforts and the variety of the proposed methods there is still much room for the development of efficient procedures for this problem.\r\n", :title "Exact methods for Arc Routing Problems", :keyword2 57, :authors (1872), :session 3370}, 18889 {:keyword1 7, :keyword3 57, :abstract "This tutorial aims at presenting well-known results and perspectives in dynamic lot-sizing to beginners in the field or to researchers interested in refreshing their knowledge.

Their popularity resides in their robustness, inexpensiveness, flexibilty, versatility and performance compared to existing methods, their adaptation to specific structures of addressed problems and their ability to solve real-world large-scale nonconvex programs.\r\n\r\nDC Programming and DCA address the problem of minimizing a function f which is the difference of two convex functions on the whole finite dimensional Euclidean space X or on a convex set C contained in X. If f = g-h then g-h is a DC decomposition of f and g, h DC components of f. DC Programming is a natural and logical extension of Convex Programming, sufficiently large to cover almost all nonconvex programs but not too in order to use the powerful arsenal of modern Convex Analysis and Convex Optimization. The set of DC functions on X, denoted DC(X), is the smallest vector space containing the \"convex cone\" C(X) of lower semicontinuous proper convex functions on X. DC(X) is large enough to contain most real-life objective functions and is stable with respect to usual operations in optimization.\r\n \r\nDC programming investigates the structure of DC(X), DC duality and local and global optimality conditions for DC programs. A dual DC program, defined with the help of the conjugate functions g*, h* of g and h respectively, is the minimization of h*-g* on X. Relations between local/global solutions of primal and dual DC programs are quite simple. The complexity of DC programs clearly lies in the distinction between local and global solution and, consequently, the lack of verifiable global optimality conditions. \r\n\r\nDCA is based on DC duality and local optimality conditions. The philosophy of DCA is to bring back DC(X) to C(X): solving a DC program by as sequence of approximate convex subprograms. \r\n\r\nDCA's distinctive feature relies upon the fact that DCA deals with the convex DC components g and h but not with the DC function f itself. Moreover, a DC function f has infinitely many DC decompositions which have crucial implications for the qualities (speed of convergence, robustness, efficiency, globality of computed solutions, ...) of DCA. \r\n\r\nDCA is a descent method without linesearch (so very appreciated in large-scale problems) but with global convergence. Remark that with appropriate DC decompositions, DCA permit to recover, as special cases, most standard algorithms in Convex/Noncovex Programming.\r\n\r\nThese theoretical and algorithmic tools have been successfully used by many researchers and practitioners to model and solve their nonconvex programs in different fields of Applied Sciences. \r\n\r\nExtension of DCA to DC programs with DC constraints by using penalty techniques/ linearizing DC constraints (as in DCA for standard DC programs) with updating penalty parameter, exact penalty and error bounds in DC programming, DC relaxation for lower bounding in Branch-and-Bound techniques applied to DC programming, have been constantly investigated during the last decade. \r\n\r\nThis tutorial on DC programming and DCA will be comprised of four parts. First we outline basic theoretical and algorithmic tools for an easy understanding of the DC Programming and DCA’s philosophy, while in the second part we show how to solve several classes of hard problems in Combinatorial Optimization and Operations Research by DC Programming and DCA. The third one is devoted to applications of these theoretical and algorithmic tools for modelling and solving some real world nonconvex programs in Machine Learning, Image processing, Communication Systems, Finance, Transport-Logistic and Supply Chain Management.

He amazed me by finding values for LL parameters from the financial statements of the company.

Profits increased substantially.

Solutions require a trans-disciplinary collaborative approach, where industrial and systems engineers, operations researchers, and management scientists can make significant contributions by developing realistic data-driven and model based approaches to promote evidence based decision making and informing policy changes.

These algorithms generate sequences of points which satisfy strictly the inequality constraints, as opposed to simplex like methods, which typically evolve on the boundary of the feasible set. They were initially based on the use of barrier functions to deal with the inequalities, and were applied to nonlinear problems with a small number of variables. In 1985, Karmarkar showed how to use interior points to solve the Linear Programming problem in polynomial time, for the first time challenging the supremacy of the simplex method in practical applications. This started a revolution in mathematical programming, which coincided with the decrease in cost of computation, which made powerful workstations accessible to all researchers. Interior point methods were then implemented for linear programming, and its realm spread to linear complementarity problems, semi-definite programming, conical problems and back to nonlinear programming. The problem sizes for linear programming grew from a maximum of some thousands of variables in 1980 to the 2008 record of one billion variables with hundreds of millions of constraints.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the basic ideas of interior point methods and a brief survey of their evolution and state of the art.", :title "Interior Point Methods for Mathematical Programming", :keyword2 49, :authors (219), :session 3376}, 18908 {:keyword1 68, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Mathematical optimization is IT best kept secret.

This first session takes a more technical approach, focusing on modeling and solving aspects. We start with a discussion of design choices, including the choice between different types of modeling systems and architectural issues, and comment on their impact on the project organization.\r\nThe modeling system chosen for the implementation of an optimization application needs to support the solution techniques that are required for solving a given optimization problem - ranging from the solver choice, to possibilities for implementing or connecting to problem-specific algorithms and solution heuristics, such as may be required by decomposition approaches. Whilst availability of a suitable solver or solving technology certainly is a necessary condition, other considerations should also be taken into account for the choice of the implementation platform, particularly when designing large applications that most likely will remain in use over a longer period of time and may need extensions or modifications to their initial definition.  \r\nThe employed modeling platform should be easy to use and to learn, allowing its user to select and learn about just the required features, and thereby making it possible to move quickly from the prototype stage to final deployment. At the same time, a modeling system is generally expected to provide efficient access to external data sources, as well as interfaces for embedding optimization models or algorithms into other systems. This also implies its availability across different standard operating systems and platforms. Particularly for projects involving experimentation or research, a relevant question to study is 'what happens if I need an unsupported feature?' - that is, how flexible is a system or which open entry points does it provide? Another important aspect of application design are possibilities for structuring of large-scale applications, such as support for the separate development, testing and deployment of different components, resulting in easier maintenance and also providing scope for collaborative development work.\r\nWe present examples of how these different questions relating to aspects of application design are addressed by the Xpress-Mosel environment: on the language level (including the use of tools like a profiler and debugger); through its open, modular design that makes it possible to select among a set of readily available solver and data handling modules or even to add new external libraries without any modification to the core system; and perhaps most importantly, Mosel's support for distributed and remote computing, including sequential and concurrent decomposition approaches, the use of multiple solvers, and also efficiency and security considerations.\r\nFurthermore, we shortly comment on possibilities in Mosel for the interaction with application layers and visualization tools, the user side of which are explored in the second talk of this mini-series.", :title "Developing optimization applications - Part 1: Modeling techniques for large scale optimization problems", :keyword2 0, :authors (21574), :session 3332}, 18923 {:keyword1 98, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The OR community usually focusses on capabilities of optimization solvers and techniques for building optimization models. Little time is spent on modeling technology and the need for rapid development of complete optimization solutions is usually not considered at all. In this second talk of the mini-series, we review possibilities and requirements for the design, implementation and deployment of interfaces for end-user interaction with optimization models. After a review of key paradigms for successful optimization projects and flexible optimization solutions, we shall present examples of applications implemented with FICO Xpress-Insight. \r\nDuring the development of the optimization model in a typical optimization project, interaction with business experts is critical for the success of the project. Visualization of solutions and data management in early stages of the project lifecycle leads to much shorter development times, less modeling errors and strong buy in from the business users.  A scalable solution architecture with basically no effort for achieving a first user interface and the maturity and flexibility to grow into the full solution would be the perfect fit.\r\nAfter the initial delivery of a custom optimization solution the optimization model typically undergoes regular updates. Those changes often also require modifications to the graphical user interface. A user interface that is largely auto-configured from the optimization model can automatically adjust to model changes. This leads to quick and cheap iterations of these updates and thus guarantees long term usage of the optimization solution.  \r\nDifferent user types want to interact with optimization solutions in different ways. The OR expert wants to have the ability to change the underlying optimization significantly during the life time of the model. The analyst wants to be able configure the model, modify constraints and have direct access to all data. Business users expect an interface which presents the underlying optimization problem in their business context and is very easy to use. Besides providing the described functionality the user interface needs to behave differently depending on the user interacting with it. All users want to be able, among other things, to carry out what-if analysis and evaluate solutions based on visualizations and reports on the solution and input data.\r\nThis is combined with requirements for collaboration and accessibility of the solution from different environments. Collaborations need a complete authentication and authorization infrastructure, for example, share insight by exchanging scenario and solution data in a flexible but still controlled manner. Different users they might prefer to interact with the solution from the desktop, through a web interface or using their mobile device.\r\nSuch a solution should be underpinned by excellent modeling and optimization tools which guarantee suitable performance for solving single optimization problems. In the context of an optimization application, many scenarios of different sizes have to be solved at the same time.  \r\nThis means not only queuing these scenarios but also distributing them across a network of local machines or utilizing cloud resources. \r\nFor illustration purposes, we will demonstrate how these requirements have been implemented in Xpress-Insight, show a number of application examples and also review code example to gain a deeper understanding of its way of functioning.

Some examples are personalized advertising and product recommendations; online reputation systems to rate buyers, sellers, and service providers; question/answer forums and discussion boards; and novel pricing mechanisms. In this talk, we will focus on three examples from social networks, illustrating the use of algorithmic tools in particular, and Operations Research techniques in general.\r\n\r\n1. Personalized advertising and recommendations: We will describe our experience designing twitter's revenue model and the initial version of its ad targeting algorithms. We will also point out the synergies between personalized advertising and personalized recommendations, and describe algorithmic techniques for real-time personalized recommendations.\r\n\r\n2. Reputation Systems and Virtual Currencies: Reputation systems are crucial for social commerce, given the large number of sellers and buyers, the ease of acquiring fake identities, and the large number of \ffirst-time transactions. We will describe a model of networked trust that is an alternative to centralized reputation/virtual currency systems on the Internet. Informally, every node in the network acts as a bank and prints its own currency, which is then used to purchase services within the network. Transactions between untrusting agents proceed through exchange of IOUs along a chain of trust. Such \"trust networks\" are robust to infiltration. We will show that in many interesting cases, the liquidity of these trust networks is comparable to a system where currency is issued by a single centralized bank.\r\n\r\n3. Polarization in Social Networks: While social networks and the Internet have made it much easier to communicate, there is considerable anecdotal and research evidence that we are getting more polarized as a society. We will present an analysis of the dynamics of opinion polarization in a social network, and discuss its implications for the design of recommendation algorithms, as well as social systems that enable large scale collective decision making.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] P.

While it offers insights in understanding such systems, probability theory is really not a  computationally tractable theory. Correspondingly, some of its major areas of application remain unsolved when the underlying systems become multidimensional: Queueing networks, network information theory, pricing multi-dimensional financial contracts, auction design in multi-item, multi-bidder auctions among others. \r\n\r\nWe propose a new approach to analyze stochastic systems based on robust optimization. The key idea is to replace the Kolmogorov axioms as primitives of probability theory, with some   of the asymptotic  implications of probability theory: the central limit theorem and law of large numbers and to define appropriate robust optimization problems to perform performance analysis. In this way, the performance analysis questions become highly structured optimization problems (linear, conic, mixed integer) for which there exist efficient, practical algorithms that are capable of solving truly large scale systems. \r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that  the proposed approach achieves computationally tractable methods for  (a) analyzing queueing systems in the transient domain and queueing networks in the steady-state domain, (b)  characterizing the capacity region of network information theory and associated coding and decoding methods generalizing the work of Shannon, (c) pricing multi-dimensional  financial contracts generalizing the work of Black, Scholes and Merton, (d)  designing multi-item, multi-bidder auctions generalizing the work of Myerson. \r\n\r\nThis is joint work with my doctoral students  at MIT Chaithanya Bandi and Nataly Youssef. \r\n", :title "A computationally tractable theory of performance analysis in stochastic systems", :keyword2 0, :authors (3025), :session 3382}, 18956 {:keyword1 8, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Extended formulations entail working in an extended variable space which typically results in a tighter formulation for mixed integer programs. The Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition paradigm and the resulting column generation reformulation is a special case where one expresses global solutions as a combination of solutions to identified subproblems. Extended formulations present the advantage of being amenable to a direct handling by a MIP solver and a rich variable space in which to express cuts or branching constraints; but their size blows rapidly too large for practical purposes. Column generation reformulation on the other hand requires a branch-and-price solver based on a specific oracle for the subproblems and efficient stabilization strategies to accelerate convergence. The combination of these two paradigms offers a truly practical approach to well-structured applications, where formulation size is handled dynamically, stabilization is less of an issue thanks to natural recombinations of  subproblem solutions, and inherent stage-by-stage approximation strategies provide primal heuristic solutions. \r\n\r\nOur presentation aims to review the pros of an extended formulation approach in combination with column generation and to highlight practical issues (such convergence and ways to address it by stabilization).
