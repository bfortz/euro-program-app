In this work, development effectiveness has been explained in a multi-dimensional framework and multi-criteria decision-making methodologies have been employed to measure it. The identification of the multiple criteria of the complex effectiveness construct has been done with the help of an ethnographic survey followed by a confirmatory analysis. The concept of relative effectiveness has been introduced to benchmark the effectiveness from that of the relatively ineffective ones. A twophase fuzzy goal programming methodology has been adopted to determine an effective portfolio for the purpose. Two case studies were also presented to demonstrate the measure of development effectiveness of the government sponsored development programme for the PTGs who are in the weakest section of the Indian society.\r\n  ", :title "Measuring the Effectiveness of Development Programmes for Vulnerable Indigenous People in India", :keyword2 59, :authors (24901 33539), :session 2150}, 16258 {:keyword1 24, :keyword3 101, :abstract "R&D project selection is a key process in organizations.

However, the network route design is generally the only one widely recognized, whilst the service planning and scheduling are often ignored in China. This leads to the lack of elaborate timetables and schedules, hence, transit operation is often in disorder with high operating cost. To raise the service level and the utilization of resources, this paper presents an applied study for three cities in China, focusing on the enhancement of the cognition and means of public transit planning and scheduling. A comprehensive framework of public transit planning is first proposed, which is composed of Chinese traditional three items (i.e., network route design, land use for depots and equipment with vehicles) and the following newly added items: intelligent public transit system (IPTS) planning, service planning and scheduling. This is pioneering work in China, during which an IPTS is planned and a random model and solution methods for vehicle scheduling based on AVL data are developed. Experiments under the actual projects show that vehicle schedules with high on-time probability and low cost were compiled, while the essential input parameters such as headways and trip times were set automatically. It is anticipated that the research fruits and practical experiences obtained would be of great benefit in increasing service and management level and resource use to the public transport in China and some other developing countries.", :title "Public Transit Planning and Scheduling Based on AVL Data in China", :keyword2 104, :authors (44079), :session 2146}, 16734 {:keyword1 26, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In this paper, we address the problem of determining the optimal number and the location of ambulance stations, as well as the vehicle allocation and repositioning for the Mobile Emergency Care Service of Sao Paulo (SAMU-SP), in Brazil. This problem arises in the context of seeking to reduce expected ambulance response times, that was within 27 minutes in Sao Paulo for 98% of the requests. In order to bring total response times down closer to internationally acceptable standards, SAMU-SP devised the concept of moveable ambulance stations that can be installed in available public spaces such as squares and parks and also can be periodically relocated to ensure a good coverage at all times. This new concept, however, was not an easy sell. It was necessary to clearly demonstrate the benefits that such stations, properly located, could provide in the context of limited budgetary resources when compared to the traditional facilities in regular buildings. In this context, we propose an optimization-based decision support system to guide SAMU-SP in its strategic decisions involving their service network, as well in the allocation and repositioning of ambulances to each stand-by points in order to cope with varying demand on different time periods.

We worked with China’s leading steel company, Baosteel, and developed advanced OR modelling and solving techniques to solve two important operations decision problems on allocating and reallocating slabs to customer orders to improve resource utilization and customer satisfaction. The problems were formulated as an integer linear programming model and a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, respectively. Column generation and Lagrangian relaxation techniques were used to solve the models. For large-scale instances of the slab allocation and reallocation problems, hybrid metaheuristic algorithms were proposed to obtain near-optimal solutions within a short computation time. The models and solution methods were successfully embedded into a computerized decision support system (DSS).

To tackle these regional water resources allocation issues at Sancha Lake, an important area in the lower-right basin of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, the local authority was seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure equitable and efficient water use for its subareas, from which the subareas would be able to provide reasonable reaction strategies. The authority dominates the water transactions between the subareas involved in water rights distribution, which shows a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium, with the subareas playing a Cournot-Nash game to develop optimum strategies. Using a multi-objective multi-stage decision making process with an uncertain stream now, a multi-objective multi-stage Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot (m2SNC) game is modeled as a bi-level equilibrium optimization incorporating fuzzy random coefficients. An interactive-dynamic-programming-based genetic algorithm (IDP-GA) is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climatic scenarios. Specifically, a complete operationalized mechanism for the Sancha Lake area is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the bi-level equilibrium model and the policy simulation procedure: (1) The bi-level equilibrium model, integrating the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium and the Cournot-Nash equilibrium, is an efficient tool to determine optimum water resource allocation strategies. (2) Similar to the principles of an input-output system and the computable general equilibrium (CGE), the policy simulation system with an IDP-GA, an extension of principle of CGE, inputs scenario data and outputs an early-warning mechanism to inform the policy suggestions.

Models constitute a key tool to achieve a deep understanding on how complex systems behave, models have been central to building the body of knowledge that we understand as “Science”. Since its origins Operations Research has claimed to be considered a scientific discipline and, as such, rooted in the model building process. A process that epistemologically is schematically represented by the methodological chain: facts→laws→theories. Kepler’s quest for an interpretation of Brahe’s astronomical observations in terms of a model, his laws of the orbital motion of planets, is a well known example of the paradigm of modern science. Since then we have learned that reality is more complex than we thought, it is uncertain and dynamic in both, probabilistic and chaotic terms. The technological evolution is supplying quality data in unprecedented amounts, and this has forced us to develop the appropriate methods to deal with them, but this only means that the methodological chain of knowledge discovering is now richer with respect to our capabilities of analyzing the facts, and therefore opens the door to deeper chances of finding laws and formulating explanatory theories. The search for Higgs Boson, frequently presented as an archetype of Analytics process, is essentially supported by the same epistemological principles that Kepler’s work.
