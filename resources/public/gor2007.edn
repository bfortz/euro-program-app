The optimal consumption/investment strategy is then given in terms of the unnormalized filter (best estimator) for the drift process.

It is of paramount importance to Operations staff to understand the specific economics of the processes under management. Simple ratio-based productivity analyses fall short of capturing the performance, which is understood as a multidimensional phenomenon including aspects such as cost, time, quality, and risk. The estimation of the specific production function for multi-input/multi-output problem settings is a necessary pre-requisite for efficiency analysis. This running dissertation project is using DEA as a tool for developing a methodology for a process-oriented performance and efficiency analysis. The methodology is applied in a single case study analysis. The object of analysis is the Securities Settlement & Clearing process of Commerzbank AG and is based on production data. The idea of this piece of research is to perform a DEA-efficiency analysis for a given process by putting the single transaction processed in the centre of the analysis (the DMU in DEA-terminology). The target is to identify and analyse the pattern and drivers of efficiency as well as inefficiency for the given banking process by bringing together the calculated DEA efficiency scores with additional process data collected alongside the process chain. As a result the inherent process performance and causal factors of inefficiency should be made transparent.

Although a host of studies report this pattern in numerous financial time series the primary source of this ARCH effect has remained unsolved. One potential explanation can be derived from the mixture of distribution hypothesis (MDH) which states that daily stock price changes as well as trading volume are jointly subordinated to an unobservable directing variable representing the process of information arrivals on the market. Since the latent information flow is assumed to exhibit serial correlation, volatility as well as volume clustering mirrors the effect of a concentration of information. Under this assumption, the processes of trading volume and conditional stock return volatility should present similar properties.\r\nIn this paper, we present empirical evidence for the fact that although the static effect of heteroscedasticity in stock returns mostly vanishes if one incorporates contemporaneous trading volume into the model of return volatility, the dynamic ARCH effect mostly maintains. For a sample of DAX and DJIA companies we show that the stochastic long-term dependencies in trading volume data typically deviate from those in return volatility. Under the assumption of the MDH this can be seen as evidence for the suggestions that the process of information arrival on the market consists of various components influencing the interesting variables in quite different ways.

With sunk investments in capacity, and low marginal costs of providing goods or services within capacity, revenue maximization in excess of salvage value becomes of paramount concern for these industries. Pricing policies that are responsive to sales can be an effective tool to enhance revenues. However, there is often a cost associated to changing prices, for example, costs to update computer databases, to change posted price in the store, to send out advertising fliers, to buy radio advertising time, and so on. This type of cost is commonly referred to as menu cost. In order to compare the change in profit resulting from dynamic pricing policies, menu cost must be considered in the total cost formulation. The effectiveness of changing prices is further complicated by demand uncertainty.

For portfolio optimization, this theorem states that the optimal portfolio of risky assets is the same for all investors regardless of their specific risk preferences or their initial wealth. For capital market theory, the separation theorem enables us to derive valuation functions for risky payoffs in equilibrium with the most important special case of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). On the one hand, one may derive the validity of the separation theorem by postulating certain properties of return distributions of securities that support the separation theorem independently of an investor’s utility function and initial wealth. On the other hand, one may justify separation for certain classes of utility functions without further restrictions on return distributions. Our paper is motivated by the latter justification and the resulting problem that the requirements of utility being defined and exhibiting a positive first derivative over the whole domain of possible portfolio return realizations restricts the possibility to derive a utility-oriented separation theorem.

It depends on factors like the number and the behaviour of the other voters, the available alternatives and, of course, also on the voting rule itself. Classical power indices like the Banzhaf- or the Shapley-Shubik-Index are only applicable for special cases. In this paper, an approach is proposed that can be viewed as a natural extension of the Banzhaf-Index for more than two alternatives and different stochastic assumptions. It allows one to compute the probability of being decisive as a function of the number of voters and alternatives for different voting rules. The behaviour of the other voters is modelled by a discrete probability distribution over the possible votes, i. e. the different messages a voter can send in an election. For example, it is possible to compare two voting rules in respect of the described probability for a given number of voters and alternatives. \r\n\r\nThe approach is applied to plurality voting with two and more alternatives. The probability of being decisive is computed for variations of the number of voters and alternatives. For three alternatives and different numbers of voters this probability is also computed for the Borda-Rule and for the class of Condorcet-consistent voting rules. The comparison of the computations for three alternatives shows that the probability of being decisive under the Borda-Rule is uniformly larger than under plurality voting.

Nevertheless, the co-integration analysis of Morris, Neal and Rolph (1998) finds a positive long-run relation between the credit spread and the risk free interest rate which is not supported by the theoretical literature.\r\n\r\nThis paper analyses the relationship between different forms of credit spreads and interest rates using the co-integration approach developed by Engle and Granger (1987). Our study is based on weekly USD corporate bond index data which is con-trolled for rating ranging from 1994 to 2006. We confirm the negative relation be-tween credit spreads and interest rates with high statistical significance. Furthermore, we find that the S&P 500 stock index and the spread between the swap curve and the Treasury yield curve can be considered as additional factors explaining the credit spread.\r\n", :title "Are Credit Spreads and Interest Rates co-integrated?

The individuals are subject to some probabilistic operators such as recombination, mutation, and selection in order to evolve the population towards better fitness values. This idea has been used in several population-based metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms, scatter search, and particle swarm optimization (PSO). These methods may include some local search component as an important factor for obtaining high quality solutions.\r\nThe basic idea of PSO is that a particle moves through the search space, thus exploring it and finding new solutions. The position of a particle is updated depending on locations where good solutions have already been found by the particle itself or other particles in the swarm. Scatter search provides a complementary perspective on PSO, operating on a relatively small number of solutions, called reference set. Some combination of two or more candidates from the reference set creates new solutions, which may be improved by means of local search.\r\nWe consider the continuous flow-shop scheduling problem (CFSP) with flow-time objective. A given set of jobs has to be processed in an identical order on a given number of machines.

In general, each operation may be executed on alternative processing units. The problem consists in determining the start times of the operations such that the production makespan is minimized. When generating the schedule we have to take into account that certain intermediates must be stocked in storage facilities of limited capacity and that chemically instable products must be consumed immediately. Moreover, a cleaning of sequence-dependent duration may become necessary between the executions of different operations on the same processing unit.\r\n\r\nDuring the execution of the baseline schedule, the durations of the operations may differ from their expected values. Furthermore, there may occur disruptions like unit breakdowns or yield losses. We show how to cope with the uncertainty in the durations of the operations by delaying the unloading of processing units, if necessary. For other types of disruptions we have to interrupt the execution of the current plan and to generate a new reactive schedule. This is done in such a way that either the deviation from the baseline schedule or the makespan of the new plan is minimized.\r\n\r\nWe have tested our method on a standard test set from literature and report on the results.

However, because of limited number of trucks and mechanical harvesters, appropriate allocation of trucks and harvesters is of crucial importance for efficiency of sugarcane harvest. In addition, the allocation of mechanized powers also influences the profits distribution among the three groups involved: sugarcane farmers, the owners of trucks and mechanical harvesters who provide harvesting and transportation services, and sugar factories. These groups usually do not have common interests. Therefore, multi-objective optimization (MOO) was applied in this study to find a compromise solution for the three groups. The parameters used in the MOO model were evaluated by using a simple sugarcane harvesting and transportation simulation derived from the field study in northeastern Thailand. The results showed that the compromise solution obtained from MOO was more acceptable than the solutions obtained from single-objective optimization. The results of analysis of variance indicated that the main factors influencing cost were the distance to a sugar factory, field size, and their interaction.

Although compulsory for all member countries of the EC and therefore of high practical importance this regulation has found little interest in models for vehicle routing so far. Especially the restrictions for driving times during several days and weeks and the optional extensions of driving times are widely neglected.\r\nThe restrictions of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 concern three different time horizons: single driving periods, daily and weekly driving times. For single driving periods there are restrictions forcing drivers to take a break of at least 45 minutes after driving periods of no longer than four and a half hours. The daily driving time is restricted to nine hours. However, twice a week the daily driving time can be extended to ten hours. Weekly driving times are restricted to a maximum of 56 hours. Still it has to be ensured that the total driving time of two consecutive weeks does not exceed 90 hours. Between two weekly driving times a weekly rest period of at least 45 hours has to be made which can be reduced to 24 hours under certain circumstances.\r\nAfter a short presentation of the most important restrictions on driving times an example is given to show that the negligence of the restrictions in the modelling process and the ex post planning of breaks can lead to infeasible vehicle routing plans.\r\nFinally, ways of incorporating the presented restrictions into vehicle routing models are discussed.

However, in many applications, these costs appear in several forms which are much more complicated than the straightforward single linear term which is usually considered in the literature. The importance of considering more general assignment costs arises, for instance, when different means of transportation are available for delivering goods from facilities to customers. Often, this also implies that a link facility-customer can be fulfilled with a combination of different capacities/modules. This is the case when, for example, we have different types of trucks that are available to supply the customers.

More recently, a new paradigm for elevator control has emerged. In destination call systems, the passenger specifies not only the direction of his ride, but the destination floor.\r\n\r\nDestination call systems are interesting from an\r\noptimization point of view, since more information is available earlier, which should allow improved planning.\r\n\r\nHowever, the real-world destination call system envisioned by our industry partner requires that each destination call (ie passenger) is assigned to a serving elevator immediately. This early assignment restricts the potential gained from the destination information. Moreover, since there is no way to specify the destination floor in the cabin, each elevator has to stop on every destination floor of an assigned call, although the passenger may not have boarded the cabin, eg due to insufficient capacity.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we introduce a new destination call control algorithm suited to this setting. Since the control algorithm for an entire elevator group has to run on embedded microprocessors, computing resources are very scarce. Since exact optimization is not feasible on such hardware, the algorithm is an insertion heuristic using a non-trivial data structure to maintain a set of tours.\r\n\r\nTo assess the performance of our algorithm, we compare it to similar and more powerful algorithms by simulation. We also compare to algorithms for a conventional system and with a more idealized destination call system. This gives an indication of the relative potentials of these systems.

When there is a call for service a patrol unit has to travel to the scene, perform on-scene service, deal with administration afterwards or perhaps go directly to a next call.\r\nIf all phases are lumped together during analysis, outcomes may be invalid and some policies can not be investigated reliably. Emergency services are typically also subject to non-stationary cyclic arrival patterns. It is known that even mild fluctuations in this pattern can greatly invalidate outcomes when average rates are used. But service processes may be non-stationary as well, even may depend on the state of the system. Such a service policy may state that no administration (a phase) is executed at given times or when the system is in a certain state to improve availability and thus performance.\r\nWe develop an approximation for the (cyclic) M(t)/Ph(t)/s/K queue that considers state-dependent service policies.

Finally, a decentralized reporting system issues some reports only to the agents.\r\n\tIf decentralization is a matter of choice, the principal (weakly) prefers global reporting, and the release of additional (costless) reports.  On the other hand, two frictions arise if the principal cannot preclude the agents from writing decentralized contracts: inefficient risk sharing and inefficient allocation of effort.  Because of inefficient risk sharing, restricting the distribution of reports may be beneficial to the principal.  On the other hand, with inefficient allocation of effort the principal may have strict preferences to no release additional reports.

They assume that the firm’s cash flows can be duplicated by financial contracts and, therefore, imply a complete market, at least for this market segment. However, due to choices of action of the management and reaction alternatives to market developments, new companies often have cash flow streams with risk profiles that cannot be duplicated at the financial market.

Labor costs are usually between their two largest operational costs.  Often once an airline has defined the aircraft routes, it starts dealing with the Crew Scheduling Problem (CSP). The CSP is the process of assigning flights to crews at minimal cost.  This assignment must be legally and physically feasible. \r\nColumn Generation algorithm (CGA) is the most common approach currently used to solve CSP. In this work, two contributions when applying the CGA are presented: The first one on the problem of finding a starting feasible solution. A fast and simple heuristic called Cycle Checking Strategy is proposed. Numerical experimentation over different instances from 3 Latin American airlines shows improvements in the efficiency of the algorithm of up to a 52% with respect to the option of starting with the well known Phase I. \r\nThe pricing problem of generating new negative reduced columns is a resource constrained shortest path problem. The second contribution is on an efficient adaptation of a label setting algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical results showed that solving this problem takes less than 16% of the total CPU time required to solve the CSP and generates relatively few columns, usually following a linear function with respect to the number of flights.  In addition, a different computational strategy of imposing no limit on the number of labels stored at the end-depot node has shown to accelerate the algorithm; results show an improvement in the solution times of up to 90.3% with respect to the option of limiting the number of labels.

Finding a minimum hamiltonian path in a weighted graph is known to be equivalent to minimizing the makespan in a single machine scheduling problem with setups. We study the complexity of the hamiltonian cycle problem in locally connected triangular grid graphs. A graph is called locally connected if the neighborhood of each its vertex induces a connected subgraph. A triangular grid graph is a finite induced subgraph of a graph associated with the two-dimensional triangular grid. The hamiltonian cycle problem is that of determining whether or not a given graph contains a hamiltonian cycle, i.e. a walk which passes through every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. \r\nThe complexity of the hamiltonian cycle problem has been intensively investigated. The problem is NP-complete for general graphs and remains difficult for graphs of many special classes. Among them, there are bipartite graphs, line graphs, 3-connected cubic planar graphs, maximal planar graphs, split graphs and others. Itai et al. (1982) have proved that the hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete for grid graphs (a grid graph is a finite induced subgraph of the two-dimensional rectangular grid).\r\nWe show that the hamiltonian cycle problem is solvable in polynomial time for locally connected triangular grid graph.

In a graph, a subset of vertices S is called dominating if every vertex outside S has a neighbor in S. A subset S is called independent if no two vertices of S are adjacent. An independent set S is maximal if no other independent set contains S. An independent dominating set is a vertex subset that is both independent and dominating, or equivalently, is maximal independent. The problem of finding an independent dominating set of minimum cardinality (the independent dominating set problem) is known to be NP-hard even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree three. A graph G is called a triangle graph if it satisfies the following triangle condition: for every maximal independent set S and every edge uv in G &#8211; S, there exists a vertex w in S such that {u, v, w} induces a triangle in G. Triangle graphs constitute an interesting non-hereditary class, i.e., a class not closed under operation of vertex deletion.\r\nWe prove that the problem under consideration is NP-complete for triangle graphs with maximum degree six. Moreover, we consider the problem of approximating the independent domination set problem for triangle graphs. We show that, for any constant K greater than 1, the independent dominating set problem on triangle graphs cannot be polynomially approximated within a factor of K, unless P = NP. We strengthen this result to some factor depending on e and n, where e is a positive constant and n is the number of vertices in the input triangle graph.

In such a scenario, the length and complexity of their supply chains have increased and so has the risk associated with it.   RFID is one such tool and the promise of RFID-enabled supply chains is that organizations will have complete, accurate, and timely visibility into all aspects of their supply chain, from suppliers, manufacturing, distribution, sales, and even return of goods. Such visibility can enable a wide range of applications, including ‘track and trace’ of individual sales units (e.g. cases or cans of soft drinks, vials of pills, etc.), accurate replenishment scheduling, and more efficient shipping and receiving. \r\n\r\nThis paper tries to see what would be the value brought by RFID generated visibility in the area of transportation and shipping.  We analyze a scenario where an organization, in response to a changed demand pattern, takes a corrective action by re-allocating its inventory which is already en-route to a specific geographic entity, to other geographical entities. Advocates of RFID claim that, dynamic allocation of inventory (including tracing, picking, de-packing and packing etc), which is undergoing transportation can be enabled, if RFID has been implemented in the transportation/ Shipping network. We develop a case study and mathematical model to evaluate if this would generate higher average profits for the organization.

The main tool for finding blue oceans is the strategy canvas, a visual depiction of strategies as value curves allowing the comparison and differentiation of industries and competitors.\r\nThe strategy canvas as presented, however, seems useful mainly for ex-post diagnosis and explanation of successful blue-ocean strategies.

Within this framework the blue-ocean strategy can then be derived as the optimal choice. The decision-analytic approach allows the entrepreneur to quantitatively derive the optimal market strategy from the preceding market analysis. Moreover, sensitivity analysis allows one to test the robustness of the strategy with respect to changes in the relevance of strategy factors (not under firms’ influence) and their values (determined by firms’ investments into these factors).

Low-quality solutions are obtained if depots are located first, regardless the future routes. In the location-routing problem (LRP), location and routing decisions are simultaneously tackled.

Each global iteration of the metaheuristic determines first a subset of open depots by considering the entire set of customers. Then, using some information about a priori good links between customers, the algorithm allocates to each customer a combination of service days compatible with its required service frequency. The resulting multidepot VRP in each day is solved by the ECWA. A local search improves the result by changing day combinations assigned to customers. Finally, a new subset of open depots is chosen using a diversification technique, and statistical information on links between customers is updated.

This paper examines the interaction between product design, investment incentives and supply chain efficiency for industrial product service systems. We develop a model in which two business models differing in the proportion of investment into product components and service components are compared. In the first business model “full service contracting” the supplier offers an operational readiness of a bundle of technological infrastructure for a lump sum. The second model “performance contracting” implies that additionally the supplier is in charge of operating the installed base (composed of services linked to a product). Here the customer does not buy the complex equipment, instead only paying for performance delivered.\r\nIn the first period the supplier has to decide about the absolute investment and its allocation into product respective service components. This effects the cost structure of the second period, where the installed base is run. If contracts are incomplete, in case of “full service contracting” the supplier has incentives to invest too much into service components in order to face lower maintenance costs in the following period. On the other hand the customer prefers supplier’s investment into product components, as it raises the productivity of the machinery. This trade-off leads to inefficient investment decisions\r\nfor the whole supply-chain.

Second, with respect to the ordering policies of the spokes or retailers we concentrate on (s,nQ) ordering policies. Starting with the single location model we derive corresponding results for the multi location situation. To avoid there instabilities we allow renting of additional resources from outside the system. Two classes of allocation policies are considered – static allocation and dynamic allocation. In the class of dynamic allocations we restrict the investigations to myopic solutions, which optimise the cost for the actual period only. We develop simple optimisation algorithms for both classes. Whereas for the static allocation we have an expression for the expected cost this is not possible for the dynamic case. Thus we use simulation to estimate the corresponding long-run average cost.

The magnitude of the planning problem is quite large as major European railway carriers need to schedule crews in order to operate several thousand trains per day.\r\n\r\nWe have implemented our solution to the railway crew scheduling problem as a column generation scheme. In our approach shifts for crews are generated in the sub-problem while the master-problem ensures that all generated shifts suffice to cover all trains with crew at minimal cost.

This formulation allows us to model most of the operational and contractual constraints into an underlying graph that is used to perform the search for new shifts.

In batch production mode, the total requirements for the intermediates and the final products are divided into batches. To process a batch, first the inputs are loaded into a processing unit, then a transformation process is executed, and finally the output is unloaded from the unit. Generally, the duration of the process is independent from the batch size. Raw materials, intermediates, and final products can be stored in storage facilities of finite capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of short-term planning of batch production is widely discussed in the literature. Roughly speaking, monolithic and decomposition approaches can be distinguished. The major limitation of the monolithic approaches is that for large instances, CPU times can be long. Recent decomposition approaches split the problem into a planning and a scheduling problem. The former consists in determining the batch size, the input and output proportions, and the number of executions for each process, and the latter in allocating the production equipment over time to the processing of the corresponding batches. A pure top-down implementation allows for computing good, but not necessarily optimal solutions within short CPU times.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our talk, we extend the decomposition approach of Neumann et al.

According to Andreoni (2006, 1998), a significant and often the largest part of the initial financial need of social entrepreneurs or major new initiatives of existing charities originates from so-called leadership-donors. In sharing the importance of the social mission, their contributions act as a starting point of its realization. However, this visionary commonality is often accompanied by other interest conflicts. In this paper, we consider a situation where leadership-donors contribute large amounts not only to one but to many entrepreneurs. Typically, these investments do not cover the full capital requirements of the social projects, which compels entrepreneurs to fill the gap via costly fund-raising campaigns in which different entrepreneurs often compete on a limited number of potential contributions. Viewed globally, the corresponding fund-raising expenditures easily reach excessive levels. In order to identify potential regulation actions that the leadership-donor can take to correct this failure, we construct a simple two-period-model in which the social entrepreneur receives the seed grant in the first period and decides on its imperfectly observable apportioning into project realization or risky fund-raising. For this service the social entrepreneur has the possibility of charging a fee. The outcome of the fund-raising campaign is known in the second period.

The objective is to maximize profit over the planning horizon by deciding whether to accept or reject a given order in anticipation of more profitable future orders. If stock is on-hand, orders can be fulfilled immediately, backlogged or rejected. In shortage situations, orders can be either rejected or backlogged to be fulfilled from future arriving supply.\r\nThe described decision problem can occur in many practical settings, as for example in make-to-stock production systems in which the production planning is done on a mid-term level (based on aggregated demand forecasts). Then – on the short-term – acceptance decisions about incoming orders are made according to stock on-hand and the planned production quantities (termed available-to-promise quantities (ATP) ).\r\nTo deal with this problem, we demonstrate two different approaches.

After reworking them to assure full functionality these items are reassembled into “good-as-new” products.

Introducing fixed costs for disassembly, remanufacturing and production lots as well as holding costs for the different types of items, the underlying problem can be formulated as a multi-level inventory system with an old product, a remanufacturing, and a new item level. The demand for remanufactured products as well as the yield rate representing the amount of items obtained from disassembling an old product are deterministically given. As the given parameters remain typically constant over time the commonly known average cost approach can be applied in order to derive the optimal solution. This contribution presents several simple policies that focus on calculating the required policy parameters, the disassembly cycle length and the number of remanufacturing and manufacturing lots per cycle. It thereby extends the general assumption that for every disassembly lot at least one remanufacturing and one manufacturing lot have to be set-up and defines the break-even points where more than one disassembly lot per cycle is required.", :title "Lot-sizing policies for remanufacturing systems", :keyword2 0, :authors (14883), :session 101}, 388 {:keyword1 106, :keyword3 97, :abstract "In the fields of public transit and airline transportation, vehicles (planes, buses) and crews are traditionally scheduled offline.

Consequently, several studies find that RIM tends to outperform DCF and DDM.\r\nThis paper demonstrates that even under less than ideal conditions identical value estimates can be achieved with the three models if they are properly adjusted.

The objective is to minimize waste.\r\nWe solve the problem using an enhanced guillotine bottom left procedure (EGBL) and its agent-based intelligent framework (AB). EGBL is the constructive heuristic GBL enhanced with a splicing procedure that improves packing quality, speeds up computation and increases the problem size that can be handled. The splicing procedure clusters items with similar properties into units, and packs them into bins on a block manner. \r\nAB is an artificial intelligence framework for a real-time production process. It consists of four modules. Modules one and two input respectively the items and the bins -as demand arises- into module 3, which fills the bins on hand with available items.

That is, modules one, two and four serve a production management purpose whereas module 3 is the solution construction module. It consists of intelligent agents dynamically interacting to jointly fill the bins. The agents collaborate to minimize waste while being individually driven by their own parameters, fitness assessment, and decision process (which is based upon EGBL).\r\nAB is particularly fast and yields near-optimal solutions for considered problem.

In California, for instance, the transportation sector is made responsible for more than 40% of all CO2-emissions. As reaction, the Californian government is forcing car manufacturers to build cleaner cars with better mileage. With regard to regulation of emissions, the law of California can be considered to be one of the most advanced. Because of this regulatory leadership, California is considered as role model by other leading regulators (EU, Japan, etc.), and successful Californian regulations will probably be introduced in other countries. As consequence of the strict regulation, the Californian market is widely regarded as leading market for clean vehicles. Therefore, vehicle manufacturers are interested in assessing the consequences of latest Californian emission regulation in order to anticipate necessary changes within the strategic planning process.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, the goal of our contribution is to assess consequences of future emission regulation from the point of view of vehicle manufacturers. Following this goal, we present a System Dynamics model for estimation of customers’ reactions to alternative fuel vehicles. In the past it could be observed that customers buy large and fast cars instead of more eco-friendly ones though being aware of the environmental problems caused by vehicle emissions. Thus, purchase decisions are modeled as market driver for introduction of alternative fuel vehicles on the market.

Least squares is so popular because it is so easily computed. It does, however, suffer from several shortcomings: it does not possess several properties that seem desirable for a data fitting method. For example, in order to apply least squares, the user needs to specify which variables are the independent variables, and which one is the response variable. A change in this setting will lead to a completely different least squares estimate. In practice, however, a distinction between dependent and independent variables is not always so easy. Another deficiency of least squares fitting is an assumption in the underlying model that may be unrealistic in many situations: the independent variables are assumed to be known exactly, a premise that is often not fulfilled.\r\nMultiple Neutral Data Fitting is an approach that avoids these shortcomings. The basic idea is that a different criterion is chosen as objective of the optimization problem: Instead of minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, we consider the deviations for each variable and multiply them. This leads to a more complicated, global optimization problem. The Multiple Neutral Data Fitting approach has beeen alluded to by several statisticians throughout the last century. Some properties of the resulting regression line have been shown, but generally speaking, the method has been discarded because of the difficulties in solving the optimization.\r\nIn this talk, we analyse Multiple Neutral Data Fitting as a global optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it.\r\n", :title "Multiple Neutral Data Fitting", :keyword2 99, :authors (2481), :session 38}, 435 {:keyword1 17, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Recently, there has been an intensive discussion about the characteristics of service productions. Two aspects are widely accepted, namely the immateriality of the service output and the necessity to integrate an external factor in the production process. It is called \"external\" because it is provided by the customer and can not be determined by the producer independently. As the producer does not necessarily know its quality in advance, the external factor is a stochastic input.\r\nNevertheless these findings have not led to the development of a modified approach to performance measurement, yet. In our contribution we deal especially with the fact that a stochastic external factor has to be included into the service production. To avoid hardly attainable a priori information about the production technology, we chose data envelopment analysis (DEA) as the basis for our methodology.\r\nThe main prerequisite for application of the methodology is the availability of different productions per decision making unit (DMU) under different, more or less favorable qualities of the external factor. For example, one could imagine that a consultancy service is provided to clients that are more or less cooperative, and therefore have a better or worse quality.\r\nUsing this information we are able to derive preference relations between inputs and/or outputs from observed production data without a priori judgments. Further discussion investigates the compatibility of the technical efficiency and the goals of the decision makers.

In this paper, we use Ant Colony System (ACS) metaheuristic to find the problem solutions, due to its more efficient exploitation strategies than others metaheuristics. The architecture proposed is based on the idea that the time horizon in which the arrival of all orders occurs is divided in n sub-periods with a time length T/nts, denominated slots, where T is the total period of the service day and nts represents the number of slots. During each slot, the problem is similar to a static VRP, but with vehicles with heterogeneous capacities and starting locations. The aim is to minimize the total travel time while trying to serve all the known orders. The architecture has been developed to run in a centralized fashion, having two main elements: Events Manager and the ACS. The Events Manager is the central structure of the solution architecture. When the orders arrive to it, they are sent to the Static Problem Element, for selecting them according with their time windows. The orders which have time window corresponding to the present slot are sent to the ACS Element. It defines, at each static problem, the number of routes and the sequence of customers to be served.

The problem can be divided into a planning and a scheduling problem. The planning problem consists in determining an appropriate set of operations yielding the required primary and secondary requirements. Each operation is characterized by the duration, the production rate, and the proportions of input and output products. Scheduling allocates processing units, input products, and storage space for output products over time to the execution of those operations. To ensure the existence of a feasible schedule, the planning problem contains conditions limiting the maximum inventory levels of intermediate products. Since the sequence in which the operations are to be executed is not known in advance, the maximum inventory levels have to be estimated. The main idea of our closed-loop procedure consists in implementing a feedback from the scheduling back to the planning level once a feasible production schedule has been found. The schedule induces precedence relationships between operations producing and consuming the same intermediates. Those precedence relationships allow us to tighten the estimates of the maximum inventory levels at the planning level. The refined planning problem is then solved again, proving a new set of operations to be scheduled. The planning and scheduling steps are repeated until we have reached a fixed point where the set of operations remains unchanged. The closed-loop procedure was implemented using the GAMS system for solving the planning problem and a priority-rule based method for the scheduling problem.

Two examples are the routing of automated guided vehicle (AGVs) in container terminals, and the routing of switching engines at cargo railroads. Typically, many constraints have to be considered like turning restrictions, required orientations of the vehicle, deadlocks, livelocks, and time windows. Collisions are defined on edges and nodes of the underlying graph. Objectives may be to minimize the sum of completion times or to minimize the schedule's makespan. The problem is dynamic, as scarce resources (e.g. tracks and lanes) are allocated over time. In an online situation, one is often forced to use a greedy approach which iteratively schedules one route at a time. Here, each route computation determines a shortest path with time windows and a following readjustment of these time windows. Clearly, this heuristic wastes some optimization potential.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we assess the quality of the iterative routing heuristic by means of a mixed integer program (MIP) for the simultaneous planning. Variables correspond to scheduled routes, so the linear programming relaxation of this large MIP is solved by column generation. The resulting pricing problem is again a kind of shortest path with time windows computation. On top of that, there are too many constraints for avoiding collisions, so these are generated dynamically as well. For large instances of practical size, the implementation of such an algorithm is non-trivial, and we report on some crucial issues, like allocation of dual variables to edges/nodes in the underlying graph of\r\nthe pricing problem.

The fishes’ weights and the interarrival times are given by the sequences of i.i.d. random variables with known distribution functions.

Using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition we split the problem into a Set Partitioning Problem as master problem and an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints as pricing problem. To strengthen the formulation we derive general CG rank-1 cuts based on the master problem formulation. Adding these cuts to the master problem means that an additional resource is added to the pricing problem for each cut. This increases the complexity of the label algorithm used to solve the pricing problem since normal dominance tests become weak when many resources are present and hence most labels are incomparable. To overcome this problem we present a number of improved dominance tests exploiting the step-like structure of the objective function of the pricing problem. Computational experiments are reported on the Solomon test instances showing that the addition of CG rank-1 cuts improves the lower bounds significantly and makes it possible to solve a majority of the instances in the root node of the branch-and-bound tree. This indicates that CG rank-1 cuts may be essential for solving future large-scale VRPTW problems where we cannot expect that the branching process will close the gap between lower and upper bounds in reasonable time.

Although scheduling is a well researched area, classical scheduling theory has been little used in real manufacturing environments due to the  assumption that the scheduling environment is static. In a static scheduling environment where the system attributes are deterministic, different analytical tools such as mathematical modelling, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound methods can be employed to obtain the optimal schedule. However, scheduling environment is usually dynamic in real world manufacturing systems and the schedule developed  beforehand may become inefficient in a dynamically changing and uncertain environment. Therefore, a flexible scheduling method that can handle system variation which results from the change of manufacturing conditions, is needed. Having the ability to learn and generalize for new cases in short time, in recent years, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have provided a means of tackling dynamic scheduling problems.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this study is to develop a neural network based decision support system for selection of different dispatching rules for a real-time manufacturing system, in order to obtain the desired performance measures given by a user.

The location work is done by the firm which locates the plants. If the firm has the control of the allocation process or if the customers know the optimality criterium from the firm and they agree with it, then it is a SPLP situation. However, the firm may not be able to force the customers to obey this criterium and it is easy that customers' preferences do not match with the firm optimal allocation.

Under premium service, customers provide advance demand information (ADI) by reserving cars ahead of the time when they need them and receive a service guarantee in return. Under classic service, customers do not make a reservation and do not receive a service guarantee. Since both demand classes access a common pool of cars, the company must decide which demands to fill and which to reject.

Since computing the parameters of the policy is computationally intractable, we propose an ADI policy that can be implemented and executed with moderate effort.
