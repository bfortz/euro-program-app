By definition, the dynamics of an anticipative system depends on its past and present states, but also on its potential future states. The concept of \"weak anticipation\" refers to an anticipation of events predicted or forecasted from a model of a system, while the concept of \"strong anticipation\" refers to an anticipation of events built by or embedded in a system. A mathematical tool to model dynamical anticipative systems deals with differential difference equations with retardation and anticipation. In delayed systems, it is possible to anticipate their future states by an incursive synchronization. A first application in operations research is the extended Kaldor-Kalecki model of business cycle with a computational anticipated capital stock, by synchronization. A second application will demonstrate that delay times in management systems produces instabilities while anticipation produces more stability. In 1992, we introduced the concepts of \"incursion\" (INclusive reCURSION) and \"hyperincursion\" (incursion with multiple solutions). For simulations, incursive algorithms show a better numerical stability than the Euler and Runge-Kutta ones. A first example is the incursive discrete non-linear Lotka-Volterra system. The second example deals with the incursive predictive control of the generalized Verhulst chaos map at any order. The third example of simulation will be the anticipation of the time evolution of an epidemics in a delayed susceptible-infected population, by an incursive synchronization. \r\n________ Papers on Computing Anticipatory Systems can be to downloaded at the website: http://www.ulg.ac.be/mathgen/CHAOS\r\n", :title "Tutorial: Anticipative and Incursive Dynamical Systems and Their Applications in Operations Research", :keyword2 23, :authors (8348), :session 91}, 1084 {:keyword1 41, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Driven by the needs of an application in finance, we have investigated the added value of global optimization compared to standard local approaches.
