sales operations. This paper analytically examines when an offline retailer's expansion online is desirable and how it affects channel members' strategies and profits in a dual channel. We found that staying out of the online market when it is still not large enough or is extremely large could be a better alternative for an offline retailer. Otherwise, a retailer's online expansion cannibalizes offline sales, but increases the retailer's overall sales. It increases the retailer's channel power at the expense of the manufacturer, who continues however to have the lion's share of the channel profit. Depending on market conditions, the retailer may or may not set the same price across channels, while the manufacturer always sets a lower price than the retailer in the online channel. Finally, a price war across channels in a relatively large online market further reduces offline prices and can drive the retailer out of the offline market.", :title "Offline retailers expanding online to compete with manufacturers: Strategies and channel power", :keyword2 24, :authors (25879), :session 903}, 7 {:keyword1 33, :keyword3 8, :abstract "Different customers induce different production costs to each stock keeping unit(SKU). Differences originate mostly from typical production lot sizes, which in their turn induce different efficient use of the production capacity available. Therefore, firms operating in a business-to-business (B2B) environment, where the number of each facility customers are measured in hundreds in contrast with thousands or millions in a business-to-customer environment, need to consider customers’ order lot size profile when calculating profit contribution of each SKU. \r\nDeparting from traditional fixed-costs allocating mechanisms, we introduce a facility location model for a B2B environment where fixed-costs are incurred when opening a facility and operating efficiency depends on the specific production jobs assigned to that particular facility. In this way, two problems are tackled simultaneously: SKU rationalisation and the capacitated facility location problems.\r\nUsing real data, we find that resulting solutions have less capacity, higher capacity utilisation, smaller and fewer facilities than current network design. Serving demand from closest facility is likely but not necessarily a biding constraint.

The new enumeration scheme makes use of the fact that the consumption of a resource by an activity is dependent on its start time. In each search node the earliest time-feasible schedule is determined by a modified label correcting algorithm where each activity is restricted to certain time points. If the calculated schedule is not resource-feasible, the resource conflict is reduced by excluding all start time points of an activity with the same resource consumption, so that the given resource conflict cannot occur in following search nodes.

The threshold separating these two deformations is called the yield criterion. When the inertial term in the equations of motion is negligible, deformation of a body is said to be quasistatic.\r\nIt is known that the quasistatic elastoplastic problem with the von Mises yield criterion can be recast as SOCP, and the one with the Tresca yield criterion can be recast as SDP. Therefore, we can apply primal-dual interior-point methods with polynomial-time complexity to these problems. However, conversion of an incremental problem to the standard forms of SOCP or SDP requires many additional variables. In this paper, we propose to solve an equivalent problem in a form of unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient method for solving this form.

These two metaheuristics are compared by means of running a series of tests that use real data, in order to measure their efficiency and effectiveness.

We develop a Markov decision process approach where the waiting time of the first customer in line is used in a discretized form to define the system state. We show that a time-based threshold policy is optimal and we develop a procedure to compute the optimal threshold. Our analysis explains some known behaviors in practice.

The goal is to understand how the governance structure of the bioenergy system impacts on its social-environmental sustainability. Bioenergy development is framed as a system of feedback processes and governance as its regulating structure. Thus, governance triggers and directs bioenergy development into certain pathways. With a triple loop learning approach, I could identify the leverages to sustainability. I used systems thinking and causal loop diagramming (CLD) to link social and environmental processes. I used the system archetypes to identify the bottlenecks and leverages to sustainability. Findings show that power relations determine which framings and interests become dominant and which policies are introduced. In both cases, politicians introduced policy schemes that responded only to specific actors´ interests. This intensified social conflicts, slowed down the system expansion and endangered sustainability. A window of opportunity to leverage the dominant power relations lies in the arising social conflicts. Social opposition seems to open a “learning” opportunity within the system. If the dominant actors are able to critically consider the demands raised by other actors, a governance change is possible.

In order to use that, we construct relaxations of the ODE solution operator, i.e., the mapping from initial values to end values. These relaxations are based on numerical discretization schemes, which provably yield lower and upper bounds on the end values.

Lower reliability corresponds to a lower capacity charge, which motivates consumers to mobilize their flexibility in electricity consumption. The duration component is regarded as the amount of ‘credits’ that consumers purchase for this slice of power. The established theory for menu design is based on numerous stringent assumptions, which may not be respected in practice, such as well-behaved (convex) cost functions. In addition, the objective of the menu design is to maximize social welfare, while the profit requirement of the aggregator is not accounted for. We formulate the MDSP menu design problem as a Stackelberg game where an aggregator moves first with a menu offering, and residential consumers react by selecting menu options, revealing their valuation. The Stackelberg game is modelled as a bi-level optimization problem involving the aggregator and consumers, and then reformulated as a mixed-integer problem.

We optimize this trade-off between energy and queueing costs by modeling the production system as an M/G/1 queue with a temperature controlled server that can only process jobs if a minimum production temperature is satisfied. The time and energy required to heat a server depend on its current temperature, hence the setup times and setup costs for starting production are state dependent. We derive the optimal policy structure for a fluid queue approximation, called a wait-heat-clear policy. Building upon these insights, for the M/G/1 queue we derive exact and approximate costs for various intuitive types of wait-heat-clear policies.

The two standard relaxation methods that are widely used for solving general BQPs are spectral methods and semidefinite programming problem (SDP), each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is a fact that small and medium-sized SDP problems can be solved efficiently by interior point methods (IPM) and also produce tighter bound for large-scale problems with a high computational complexity. While a faster and implementable RBR method has been widely used for SDP relaxed BQPs, it can be challenged by SDP relaxations because of tighter lower bound than RBR on BQPs. Departing from IPM, our methods provides better lower bound than the RBR algorithm by Wai et al. (ICASSP, 2011) and competitive with SDP solved by IPM. The method includes the spectral SDP-cut formulation on the SDP and is solved by a modified RBR method. Many wireless communication problems are based on a convex relaxation of the maximum likelihood problem which further can be cast as BQPs. However, RBR for solving SDPs could be opted for an alternative for large-scale MIMO detection because of low complexity.

The PACU is shared by multiple operating rooms (OR) and receives patients with varying levels of acuity from multiple specialties. The volume of patients coming from the OR to the PACU can vary greatly depending upon the complexity and duration of the surgical procedures. In addition, the amount of time required in the PACU can also vary greatly depending upon the level of sedation and response of the individual patients. A problem for the operating room scheduler is to schedule operations such that the PACU is not requested to take more patients than it can handle while accommodating requests from the surgeons and the patients. Each hospital is different and there is no generic scheduling system to assist the scheduler. A common approach to OR scheduling is to maximize the utilization of both the operating rooms and the surgeons without regard to the effect that this maximization might have on the downstream PACU or the patients being admitted to an inpatient unit in the hospital. A regular request from surgeons is to schedule their complex cases early in the morning and the less complex (shorter) cases later in the day.

Existing studies mainly focus on collaborative transport in order to increase the efficiency of vehicle fleet operations.

By jointly deciding on two types of decisions, namely, first which DCs to open, and, second how to allocate the quantity of product flows in the distribution network, partnering companies aim to minimise their total logistics cost. In addition, the carriers have to decide on a suitable distribution of the collaborative benefits while ensuring stability of the coalition.

As such, our research work investigates approaches to the optimisation of the cooperative carrier facility location problem in a market environment characterised by demand uncertainty.

However, the evaluation may leads to the situation that many DMUs are evaluated as efficient, and the efficient units cannot be further discriminated. Cross efficiency is a concept for solving the problem of incomparability among the efficiencies of a set of DMUs calculated from different weights in DEA, and is helpful for ranking. In the real world, observations are usually difficult to measure precisely. One way to manipulate imprecise data directly is to represent the uncertain values by fuzzy numbers. Under the framework of DEA, different fuzzy DEA approaches for measuring efficiency with fuzzy data have been proposed. However, similar to crisp DEA models, it is possible that DMUs are classified as efficient units even although the input and output data are fuzzy numbers, and this leads to the task of ranking more difficult. In this case, the fuzzy cross-efficiency evaluation can be used as a tool to rank efficient units in fuzzy environments. This study develops a novel method to calculate the fuzzy cross-efficiency scores for DMUs with fuzzy data.

The column generation method iterates between a master problem, a subproblem for generating driver variables and a subproblem for generating staff car variables. The subproblem related to the drivers is formulated as a resource constrained shortest path problem, which is solved by a dynamic programming approach. The proposed method is tested on eight real-life instances from seven Northern European companies.

Collaboration among wineries is modeled as a cooperative game, whose characteristic function is derived from a mixed inte- ger linear programming model. Real world instances of the problem are, however, unlikely to be solved to optimality due to its complex combinatorial structure and large dimension. This motivates the intro- duction of an approximated version of the original game, where the characteristic function is computed through a heuristic procedure.

Therefore, it turns relevant not only to find a stable cost allocation but also to find a coalition structure for selecting the best partition of the set of firms.

More specifically, the problem requires computing the quantities of goods to be delivered for each customer during a specified time horizon, as well as associated vehicle routes. In practice, when building IRP models, the time horizon is segmented into a sequence of finite planning periods. A salient prerequisite for effectively solving the IRP is thus to determine the proper length of these periods. Whereas short planning periods should produce more tractable variants of the IRP, they may fail to derive cost-effective solutions. The reason is that end-of-horizon effects are normally not explicitly considered, and the plans produced may imply that final inventories of customers are almost empty. This may again lead to increased costs in later planning steps. The scope of this work is to investigate for a set of benchmark instances the impact of both planning periods’ length and the inventories terminal conditions and determine a trade-off between cost and tractability.

A parametric directional distance function is employed to estimate MAC from economic perspective, and the abatement level is further incorporated to generate increasing curves, which is similar to the outcomes derived from engineering perspective. In addition, this method takes into consideration of whether the abatement level exceeds the abatement potential with current production technologies so as to provide a more realistic estimation of MAC curve. The result from this method is informative since it reflects both entire production characteristics and technological options for abatement. By using this reconciled method, how the marginal abatement cost changes response to the abatement level can be identified in a more detailed way, which can help policy makers and entrepreneurs to make better decisions on achieving reduction targets cost-effectively.

Efficient distribution planning is essential in grocery retailing due to low margins and a high impact of logistics costs on total retail costs. The store delivery policies and the resulting vehicle routes for replenishing store inventory from distribution centers reveal significant cost saving potentials. Retailers usually apply repetitive weekly delivery patterns when scheduling the workforce, defining cyclic transportation routes and managing warehouse capacities. In doing so, all logistics subsystems of a retail chain, i.e., warehousing, transportation and instore logistics, are jointly scheduled. Due to recent technological advances, retailers now have the option using multi-compartment vehicles. Grocery products requiring differing temperature zones (e.g. deep-frozen, fresh, ambient) can be transported jointly as the loading area is split into separate compartments. Packing the different product segments on one truck has also impact on the repetitive weekly delivery patterns. For example, instead of a separate delivery of frozen products once per week, the retailer can deliver this segment jointly with the daily deliveries of fresh products.

This stage is seasonal and presents high variability in fruit yield and quality. During the season, farmers or orchard managers need to plan labor quantity, raw materials required, machinery, among others, according to a harvest calendar estimated by the agricultural engineers. This task is complex because every fruit and variety has a different ripening curve and the orchards usually have many fields with different kinds of fruit and varieties. Currently, in many countries, the harvest planning decisions are taken mainly based on the experience of the farmers or orchard managers, leading to discoordination of the FSC and fruit waste during this stage. For this reason, decision-support tools are necessary in order to facilitate the decision-making process and add flexibility for unexpected changes during the harvest season. According to this, in this study we propose a the multi-objective model for planning tactical decisions for one orchard in order to establish harvesting times for each fruit variety and associated resources (workers, machinery, raw materials, among others) for optimizing fruit quality and seeking to reduce the harvest calendar.

One of the reasons for the limited use of automatic scheduling in practice is the absence of the experience-based intuition that planners apply when manually generating schedules. The relative importance of different objectives reported by the planners does not always coincide with their day-to-day decisions. Furthermore, the planners' decisions are not consistent, as their intuition perceives the quality of a schedule differently for different cases. Therefore, an automatic scheduling approach might require several iterations of adjusting the weights of different objectives to obtain a solution that meets the needs of the planners. We propose a multi-phase method to automatize these iterations, where an initial phase produces a solution, and the subsequent phases analyze the quality of the solution and seek to improve it based on various KPIs. We have defined these KPIs based on a dialog with practitioners and their intuition regarding schedule quality. Consequently, this method generates final weights based on the planners' insights, rather than their perception of the relative importance of different objectives.

An aging model is used here in which the actual processing time of each job depends on its scheduled position within the job processing sequence.

Scheduled maintenance restores machines to as-new conditions, providing a way to counter-balance the aging effects. \r\nAiming to minimize the overall makespan for the two parallel machines, two cases are analyzed. In the first case, no maintenance is scheduled, and hence the machines are always available during the planning horizon. In the second case, maintenance is scheduled within the job processing sequence, and hence the machines are not available during maintenance times. The problem of simultaneous scheduling of jobs and maintenance activities is generalized by assuming the number and the positions of maintenance stops to be variable. Integer programming models are formulated to determine the optimal number of maintenance stops and the optimal sequence of jobs and maintenance stops on each machine.

Remsoft Woodstock was used to build a decision support system (DSS) for Ireland’s Western Peatland forests. The DSS was built to analyse potential impacts on forest management from three global scenarios with various degrees of climate change (CC) and increasing timber prices from an expanding bioeconomy. Linear programming (LP) was used to maximise net present value (NPV) over a 100-year planning horizon, using a 5% discount rate. Three constraint sets were included: to avoid over-harvesting, to ensure replanting after clearfelling, and to establish buffer zones. The study area contained 9,899 ha of forest in 2,777 polygons. The generated LP matrix model contained around 2,340,000 columns, 673,000 rows, and took around 5 hours to solve using 32 GB RAM and a 3.20GHz processor with 6 dual-thread cores. The results showed an NPV increase of 26 to 58% in the scenarios with global change, compared to no changes. The model was also run with CC but without dynamic prices, and vice versa. These runs showed that CC had a negative impact on NPV (decreasing NPV by 7% in one scenario), while the dynamic timber prices resulted in an increase in NPV. This study demonstrated that implementation of CC and dynamic timber pricing in a forest management DSS is feasible and straight-forward, but that reliable data on future conditions are essential.", :title "Impacts on Irish forestry from climate change and an expanding bioeconomy - using linear programming to solve complex forest management problems", :keyword2 18, :authors (61063 61413 9976), :session 763}, 647 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Coalitional multinomial values were introduced by Carreras and Puente in 2015.

The appeal of the window fill rate is that it incorporates the fact that customers usually tolerate a certain wait either due to patience or as a result of contractual agreement. We develop approximating formulae for the window fill rate and consider the spares allocation problem which is finding the spares allocation that maximizes the window fill rate subject to a given budget of spares.

This research focuses on the calculation of finite-time ruin probabilities and capital reserves for a multi-dimensional risk model. The individual reserves of these lines of business are modeled by means of a Cramér–Lundberg model with constant incoming premiums and outgoing claims that arrive according to a Poisson process. To allow for dependence between business lines we introduce a common (latent) environmental factor. This environmental factor impacts the claim inter-occurrence times as well as the claim sizes. Considering a fixed environmental process over time, we present a novel Bayesian approach to calibrate the latent environmental state distribution based on observations concerning the claim processes. We then we allow for the distribution of individual claims to change over time by using a Markov environmental process. For the latter, we present two approximations for the finite-time multi- variate survival/ruin probabilities: a diffusion approximation and a single-switch approximation.

By analysing the tweets put out by different companies, we show that there is a correlation between specific words in the tweets and the credit rating. Furthermore, we will show that using these words in a predictive model leads to an increase in predictive power when comparing with a model not containing these words as predictors. \r\nSecond, we are using differential language analysis for identifying linguistic features in tweets that are most predictive of a change in credit ratings, a method which is usually used in psychology and health and has not been used in a financial context before. \r\nThird, we use a very large and unique dataset of variables from different frequencies for the analysis.

Special attention is paid to belief dominance: a concept that supports decision-making under multiple probability characterizations by ruling out strategies that are dominated across the full range of beliefs. We uncover a distinction between two types of dynamic inconsistency, which we label fallacious and fallible inconsistency. Fallacious inconsistency occurs when a strategy that was optimal in the first-stage is found to be sub-optimal in a later stage. Fallible inconsistency implies that an action is optimal in the second stage, although that action was not included in any optimal strategy in the first-stage. Fallible inconsistency is less severe, as it doesn’t necessitate a rational decision-maker to depart from her original strategy, as fallacious inconsistency does. Using corresponding definitions for dynamic consistency, we show that the two are equivalent for complete orderings, but differ for incomplete orderings, such as dominance relations. Subjective expected utility is dynamically consistent while non-expected utility decision rules, such as minmax, are not. Belief dominance falls between these two: it is immune to the more severe fallacious inconsistency, but not to the less problematic fallible inconsistency.

In addition to proposing efficient allocation algorithms, there is a need for accurate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of this process. In this paper, a KPI to assess the quality of a customer allocation plan is developed. Since short supply is faced, demand fulfilment KPIs such as delivery reliability could not be used. Thereby we propose a performance measure depending only on how fair and equitable allocations to customers are. Although customers’ priorities should be considered, maximizing customer satisfaction needs a supply distribution proportional to customer orders.

The central innovations are the ability to optimise both the structure of the DH network and the location of the DH plant, the consideration of partial heat supply from DH and the scalability to many larger municipalities. A comparison of optimisation and heuristic for three exemplary municipalities demonstrates that the heuristic is between 500% and 1x107% faster than the optimisation. The resulting deviations in the calculated total investment for the DH system from the results of the optimisation are in all cases below 5%, and in 80% of cases below 0.3%. The efficiency of the heuristic is further demonstrated by the comparison with the Nearest-Neighbour-Heuristic. The latter is not only less efficient, it substantially overestimates the total costs by up to 80% in all cases with less than 100% DH heat coverage.

In particular, our SO framework aims to improve the quality of the incumbent solution in the SA algorithm via implementing two enhancement strategies. The first strategy is to employ a non-linear mixed-integer-program to approximate the PSP in order to generate a high quality initial feasible solution. This is achieved via modeling the polyclinic under investigation as a D/M/1 queue and approximating the expected patient wait-time with an analytical (nonlinear) function. The second strategy relies on introducing a diversification mechanism within the SA algorithm. Our numerical results based upon the data provided by a polyclinic in a university health center in Montreal, Canada, confirmed the significance of incorporating stochastic functions such as patient wait-time and physician overtime into PSP.

Robotic mobile fulfillment systems are gradually finding their way in many e-commerce warehouses which used to be operated mainly manually.  While robots can carry items over large distances in expansive warehouses efficiently, they lack the dexterity, the skill, to grab a variety of item shapes and sizes.  This lack of dexterity also makes the role of humans in the warehouses invincible.  Hence, robots can collaborate with human pickers to carry out the order fulfillment jobs more efficiently and ergonomically. In a human-robot collaborative pick environment, robots work alongside pickers to improve the pick efficiency by reducing the pickers' unproductive walking time. However, the optimal picker deployment strategy, pooling pickers across all zones (parallel) or dedicating pickers to a warehouse zone (sequential), is not clear. In this research, we compare two picking strategies, parallel and sequential, using dynamic models.

The analysis considers a heterogeneous fleet, meaning that buses of different sizes and technologies can be assigned under a budget constraint. Numerical experiments show that the MA performs as well as state-of-the-art algorithms where CO2 emissions are not considered, obtaining very good solutions under reasonable computing times. Additionally, several experiments are performed to observe the effect of incorporating CO2 emissions and a heterogeneous fleet into the TNDFSP. It is shown that significant reductions in the emissions can be achieved while only slightly increasing the total travel time and maintaining the cost, compared to the solution aiming at minimizing travel time. In the tested instances, the emissions can be reduced around 30% by increasing the travel time only around 1.5%. Even in the scenario with a homogeneous fleet, emissions can be reduced around 8% increasing the travel time less than 1%.

The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with alternative subgraphs (RCPSP-AS) allows to model alternative execution modes for subsets of activities or work packages in the project structure. This extension of the well-known RCPSP relaxes the assumption of a deterministic project structure in order to be able to better deal with the complex and uncertain project environment. The aim of the RCPSP-AS is to schedule the selected activities subject to technological and resource constraints such that the project makespan is minimized. In the presence of uncertainty, the alternatives in the project structure could also be used to create a set of back-up schedules in order to tackle unexpected disruptions in the project. At different decision moments during the project execution, these alternative schedules can then be switched to overcome disruptions. In this research, we present an approach to construct so-called similar and dissimilar sets of high-quality back-up schedules for instances of the RCPSP-AS. The degree of similarity of a set of schedules is determined by the number of included alternative schedules with similar selected alternatives in the project structure.

Most of the existing literature on project risk response focuses on determining response strategies to reduce the expected loss of risks. However, an effective risk response, in general, requires financial support, and an optimal budget allocation among risk response strategies can produce better risk response effects. This paper proposes a method that integrates fault tree analysis with a new optimization model to allocate a response budget from a preventive and protective perspective. The proposed method consists of three main steps. The first step is to analyze and calculate risk probabilities and risk losses which involve identifying risk causes that may trigger a risk event to occur using fault tree analysis. It also identifies consequences once the risk event occurs, evaluating the occurrence probabilities of risk causes and losses of consequences. The second step is to build a relationship between the budget allocated to risk response strategies and the corresponding response effects.

To assess learning processes and related behaviour changes in this complex environment, we evaluate its development throughout the project. We will compare a baseline scenario (initial situation regarding operational flood forecasts and alerts) for the main interested actors with their preferences over time.

Providers of collective door-to-door transport, called dial-a-ride services, are increasingly invoked to replace unprofitable public transport in rural areas. This requires an integrated mobility system in which a user's trip may consist of a combination of dial-a-ride services and regular public transport. To optimally integrate both systems from an operational point of view, dial-a-ride providers need to solve a challenging routing problem, in which their flexible vehicle routes should be synchronized to the timetables of the remaining public transport services. However, the practical feasibility of such an integrated mobility system strongly depends on the reliability of the transfers. Dial-a-ride providers should adequately respond to structural or occasional delays of the public transport. Whenever such delays are likely to cause broken connections or violated quality requirements, the provider needs to make real-time adaptations to its routes and schedules, restoring feasibility at an additional cost. The objective of this work is to quantify the sensitivity of integrated routing solutions with respect to delays on the public transport network. To this end, the travel times of the public transport are modeled as stochastic, time-dependent travel times.

In order to avoid that the most qualified workers take over the majority of the jobs while some workers are idle, restrictions on their maximum workload are needed.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the problem of assigning jobs to workers can be modelled as a scheduling problem with jobs on unrelated machines with unknown processing times and maximum machine load.\r\n\r\nWe discuss several variants of the problem, present mechanisms, the corresponding equilibrium solutions and evaluate their quality.", :title "Mechanisms for Scheduling Jobs with Unknown Processing Times on Unrelated Machines", :keyword2 96, :authors (61680 930 33211 5965), :session 57}, 1263 {:keyword1 157, :keyword3 53, :abstract "The Inmate Transportation Problem (ITP) is a common complex problem in any correctional system.

When applied to the Italian regional case-study the σ-μ efficiency while confirming the overall North-South divide, shows a more nuanced picture with interesting differences with respect to well-established alternative aggregation techniques such as equal weight and Mazziotta-Pareto index.", :title "A balanced development?

Several methodologies are available for this problem class, such as online optimization, multi-stage stochastic programming and multi-stage robust optimization.

In practice, information about the future is only available for a rather narrow time window and not for the entire decision horizon. Typically, new information is revealed gradually and information concerning later periods is based on forecasts. Hence, the multi-stage problem dissolves into a series of highly coupled snapshot problems that contain uncertain parameters. \r\nIn this talk we present a new modeling framework for multi-stage problems that incorporates all three methodologies on the snapshot problem level, thus providing the decision maker with a rich toolbox from different fields.

This paper studies a model where consumers estimate the quality of products from like/dislike reviews and make choices using a multinomial logit model. We explore the impact of choice on the learning outcome, and using a large market (fluid model) approximation, we study how choice and product parameters affect learning speed and derive some intuition on the primitives that matter the most. Finally, we address the following product display problem: assuming that consumers suffer some search cost to go down the list of displayed products, which order of products should the platform use to speed up learning and purchases?

Order smoothing reduces demand variability at the upstream stages and lowers their capacity and inventory costs. At the same stage, it increases inventory variability at the ordering stage and incurs high holding costs.

This helps planning agricultural operations and provides security of income, which is critical for the farmer livelihoods. One such example is the PNAE government feeding program in Brazil, where schools source raw materials and ingredients from local smallholder farmers for school meals. This work presents a Decision Support System (DSS) supporting farmers decisions on which schools to supply, with which products and how to organise the logistical activities, to maximise the net income from participation in these markets. The DSS is applied after the farmers have knowledge which bids they have been successful in, and therefore they have clarity on the potential supply areas. The decisions at this stage can be quite complex, with several factors to be considered simultaneously, such as product range, quantities and price for each school that a bid was won, distance and logistical costs, and logistical synergies when delivered quantities in the same area are larger.

Thus, from the printing company's point of view, a customer order comprises several order lines with varying demands for different sorts, which have to be delivered together in a batch.

To support the routing of on-demand buses we define a new optimization problem: the on-demand bus routing problem (ODBRP), which combines the dial-a-ride problem (DARP) with bus stop selection, introduced in the school bus routing problem. Given a set of requests for transportation, indicating a passenger's departure and arrival location, as well as his/her preferred arrival time, the aim of the problem is to (1) assign each passenger to a departure and arrival bus stop within walking distance, and (2) develop a set of bus routes, picking up passengers at their departure stop and delivering them to their departure stop before their preferred arrival time. The first decision is called bus stop assignment. The goal is to group customers so that the bus can avoid extra stops and detours. This way there is more flexibility for the routing and the efficiency of the system increases.

Clearly, synchronization depends on a large set of unknown events (lateness of transportation, slow execution of handling operations, service interruptions, etc.). Therefore, the selection of transshipment facilities must be done under uncertainty. In fact, congestion, significant containers leftover, and loss of connections could cause both unexpected reductions of facilities capacity (over time horizons) and stochastic handling utilities. Hence, we introduce a stochastic and multi-period variant of the Transshipment Selection Problem in which uncertainty of facility capacity and handling utilities are both considered.

While the crew pairing problem (CPP) finds a set of low-cost feasible pairings, the crew rostering problem (CRP) uses those pairings to create a roster that abides by a set of rules. This talk focuses on language constraints, imposing requirements on the language skills of the crew composition of some legs. Such constraints are traditionally included only in the CRP. One shortcoming of the sequential method is that the pairings returned by the CPP may be incompatible with the language skills of the crews.\r\n\r\nWe propose a variant of the CPP, called CPP with language constraints (CPPLC), that includes soft language constraints (their violation is penalized in the objective) limiting the amount of work that can be performed in any language. The linear relaxation of the CPPLC is solved using column generation. One of the challenges in solving the CPPLC is the explosion of the number of subproblems. We, therefore, propose a subproblem selection strategy in which a small subset of these subproblems is solved at each column generation iteration. Different acceleration strategies are also put forward. We present results highlighting the performance of the method on several large-scale instances.

Each platform sets a price that is charged to customers for obtaining service. A portion of that price is paid to the driver that delivers the service. Customers' and drivers' utilities are sensitive to the payment terms and to congestion in the system. We consider two possible scenarios. Under \"single-homing,\" drivers work through a single platform. Under \"multi-homing,\" drivers deliver service through both platforms. In both scenarios, we study the equilibrium prices that emerge from the competitive interaction between the platforms and explore the outcomes that can arise at equilibrium. We leverage the model to study some practical questions that have received significant press attention. The first involves the issue of surge pricing. The second involves the increasingly common practice of drivers choosing to operate on multiple platforms (multi-homing). We find that raising prices in response to a surge in demand makes customers better off than if platforms were constrained to charge the same prices that would arise under normal demand levels.

In this context, we aim to reduce the computation time for overlaid traffic flows based on shortest OD policy. The major approach heretofore has been combination of finding a shortest path followed by increments of traffic counts along the optimal route. While the bottleneck seems on the former, the actual has been on the latter: tracking backward along the optimal route.

When operating headways are small (high-frequency routes), any perturbation (e.g., in the number of passengers using the facility, traffic conditions, etc.) makes the system unstable, and the headway variance tends to increase along the route. Eventually, buses end up bunching, i.e., they start traveling together. This results in inefficient service and is one of the critical problems faced by bus agencies. Another important aspect is the expected time that a typical passenger has to wait before the arrival of its bus. The bunching phenomenon might reduce if one increases the headway. However, this can result in unacceptable waiting times for the passengers. We precisely study this inherent trade-off and derive a bus schedule optimal for a joint cost which is a convex combination of the two performance measures. We derive the stationary (constant headway) as well as the transient (trip-dependent headway) policies. We pose this as a finite horizon control problem; obtain the optimal policy by solving relevant dynamic programming equations, which lead to an easily implementable algorithm. We obtained the Pareto frontier of the two performance measures by using this algorithm with different tradeoff parameters.

Specifically, we consider delivering goods to customers within given time windows, and we improve customer satisfaction by giving the distributor the possibility to dynamically reassign the time windows of the customers when faced with uncertainty. Time window reassignment in itself is not appreciated by the customer. However, being informed timely that a delivery will be made in a later time window is preferred to not being informed at all. To the best of our knowledge, dynamically reassigning time windows to improve customer satisfaction has not been considered in the literature. We assume that travel times and service times are stochastic, and that their value only becomes known after serving a customer or traveling an arc, respectively. This setting is relevant for, e.g., parcel delivery and repairmen scheduling. We first consider the case where the route is fixed and we have to decide when to reassign which time window, and how much the time window is moved. We model customer satisfaction and we provide exact and heuristic methods for reassigning time windows to maximize satisfaction. Next, we explore integrating customer satisfaction into the routing phase. We present results comparing the optimal time window reassignment to multiple heuristics that are inspired by practice.

Its future relevance for solving hard optimization problems in many practical fields, including finance, logistics and production, is leveraged through the increasing availability of powerful computing capabilities. We suggest a framework for computational parallelization in OR, which distinguishes four layers of parallelization: 1. the object of parallelization, 2. the algorithmic parallelization, 3. the computational parallelization, and 4. the performance of parallelization. We use this framework to systematically synthesize how the OR discipline has made use of modern parallel computing capabilities, including high performance computing capabilities, in the past decade. This synthesis provides an overview of recent advancements in OR across problems and methodologies by revealing, for example, how machine scheduling problems, flow shop scheduling problems, knapsack problems, traveling salesman and vehicle routing problems have been solved through the parallelization of branch-and-X methods, dynamic programming, and various metaheuristics.

This step relies on well-established crop-soil-atmosphere dynamic models such as AquaCrop, DSSAT or SWAP. After computing all the relevant water productivity functions, optimal crop selection and/or water allocation is obtained by solving a single-objective (profit) optimization problem formulated using these water productivity functions. Before the start of the growing season, the proposed formulation enables solving simultaneously the problem of crop selection (or land allocation), i.e. which crops should be planted where, and water allocation, i.e. how much water should be provided to each crop, using historical weather data. During the growing period, the same formulation can be used to re-optimize periodically water allocation, taking into account the actual weather and the irrigation implemented so far, as well as changes in factors such as water quotas or crop value.

Water shortages throughout the world have shaped the development of demand management and supply enhancement options to improve water supply reliability. Climate change adds another layer of deep uncertainty to forecast surface water availability. The society is facing a trade-off between cost of a water supply-demand strategy and water shortage risks in the long run. For urban pumping reservoir, there are considerable additional costs for purification to make the water safe and healthy for human consumption. An important cost to be considered is the considerable increase in water purification costs. \r\nThis work presents an investment decision-making tool to identify a portfolio of sustainable efficiency improvements, flood control investments that the market regulator authority can implement pursuing the objective of minimizing water shortage severity while achieving a target level of reliable service. \r\nThe optimization model aims at minimizing the costs of water supply-demand portfolios over the entire planning horizon: capital and construction costs, operation and maintenance costs, social costs, and environmental costs.

On the one hand, researchers have focused on proactive and reactive project scheduling, where proactive planning attempts to build a stable project plan that takes the possible disruptions as much as possible into account, while the reactive planning procedures are called every time the disruption changes the baseline schedule such that it cannot be executed anymore as planned. On the other hand, a lot of research has been done on the stochastic RCPSP that introduces scheduling policies that decide at each of the stages of a multi-stage decision process which activities selected from the set of precedence and resource feasible activities have to be started. Recently, Davari and Demeulemeester have introduced an integrated proactive and reactive project scheduling problem for the RCPSP with uncertain durations and developed different Markov Decision Process models to solve this NP-hard problem. This means that not only a good baseline schedule is determined, but also several good continuations in case certain combinations of the activity durations occur that prohibit the baseline schedule or an already adapted schedule from being executed as planned.

Using this information when controlling the inventories for these items enables retailers to increase their performance.

For a wide range of perishable items, the total costs for out-of-stocks, waste and holding inventory are compared for these scenario’s, using simulation. As expected, the scenario with full visibility of expiration dates offers the lowest costs. One way to achieve this full visibility is via an investment with RFID tags on each consumer unit. However, a large part of the benefits from full visibility can be gained by a scenario with partial visibility requiring a smaller investment. In the latter scenario, only at the moment a new batch arrives in the store, the expiration date and the quantity of that batch is registered, e.g. by reading an extended barcode from each case pack.

A simple game is a weighted voting game if there is an integer quota and an assignment of a non-negative integer weight to each player so that a coalition is winning if and only if the sum of the weights of its players is greater than or equal to the quota. It is known that each simple game can be expressed as the intersection (or the union) of weighted voting games.\r\nTwo essential concepts well known over simple games are the dimension and the codimension. The dimension (codimension) is the minimum number of weighted games such that their intersections (unions) generate the considered simple game.

For instance, some authors have studied the maximum dimension or codimension that can be achieved with a specific number of players.

The main characteristic, and at the same time the main difficulty, of this problem is the irregular shape of the pieces.

We align the corresponding pairs of reads using a semi-global variant of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which finds optimal alignments. Since it is computationally demanding and easily parallelizable we use a very efficient GPU implementation. The method produces an alignment score and a shift value for each pair of examined reads. If overlaps are sufficiently long and the number of alignment errors is below a given threshold arcs are created.  Additionally, we implemented several further steps such as the creation of the smallest lexicographical index, which results in a denser graph.

Addressing decisions to the good enough solution rather than to the optimal one depends on many reasons, such as: the difficulty to access and process the information needed to take a good decision; the instance of achieving a balance among different dimensions of urban development, namely the economic, environmental and social ones; the not always consensual preferences of the stakeholders involved in these kind of processes.

This approach enables us to solve instances with up to 5 nests and 500 products in short computing times.

The former represents the profit loss from introducing green products, while the latter accounts for the profit gain from sustainability consumption. By disentangling the firm’s development and production decisions, we find that the firm might develop conventional products only, but never green products only. Nevertheless, it might decide to produce green products only for the entire market, thus leaving the green segment with a positive consumer surplus.

High fidelity simulations are more accurate, but also more computationally expensive.  The goal of this work is the design of algorithms that optimize with respect to the high-fidelity simulation, but exploit the use of lower fidelity codes as much as possible.  Two new surrogate-based mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithms are presented, in which interpolating surrogates are constructed and updated from previously evaluated iterates of the algorithm to speed convergence.  The first algorithm employs a recursive Search step that optimizes a surrogate function constructed from the next lower fidelity level simulation augmented with an interpolating surrogate that accounts for the difference between adjacent levels of fidelity.  The second approach is an augmentation of the optimization problem, in which the fidelity level is incorporated as a variable in the problem, but is constrained to be at the highest level of fidelity at the solution.

Furthermore, the proposed rank-one strengthening can be interpreted as a non-separable, non-convex sparsity-inducing regularizer, which dynamically adjusts its penalty according to the shape of the error function. In our computational experiments with benchmark datasets, the proposed conic formulations are solved within seconds and result in near-optimal solutions (with 0.4% optimality gap) for non-convex L0 problems.

There are many potential factors that may decrease operational efficiency, one of which is waiting times by freight vehicles on streets. In transportation planning contexts associated with freight vehicles, buffer time is key to reduce the risk of delay. Extra vehicles as well as hubs are prepared. However, excess resource assignment would force freight vehicles to wait on a street to observe the scheduled times. This would impact the efficiency of operation. Consumption of buffer times would be at facilities located for a particular purpose to wait. If vehicles can share facilities in an efficient manner to reduce waiting times, then the operation of the road network is efficient. The flow-capturing location-allocation model (FCLM) is a traditional location model for facilities capturing traffic flows. However, it solely focuses on maximizing the covered traffic flows. In location planning contexts for facilities aiming to consume buffer time, the following two factors needs to be considered as well, (1) temporal relationship to reduce buffer time, and (2) capacities of facilities. The former (1) is attained by adjusting the total buffer time of all freight vehicles to zero. The latter (2) is achieved by considering an upper traffic flow that a facility is capable of serving.

Advantages and disadvantages of existing offline depots need to be combined wisely. While picking orders is more efficient in DCs, transportation costs are lower and customer service levels are higher for local stores in close customer proximity. Further, each depot offers different delivery options due to heterogeneous vehicle fleets and product availability.

We identify decision relevant costs for the order processing in each depot type and enable a realistic evaluation of overall fulfillment costs.

The users set different parameters to the visits, like availability time windows, duration, day of the week, etc. Apart from that, to correctly schedule the visits, the company must consider nurses' contracts, travel times and the fact that users prefer not to have their caregiver changed. To solve this scheduling problem we first propose an integer programming problem but, because the real instances we need to solve are of great size (resulting in a huge number of variables and constraints), we designed an heuristic algorithm that provides good solutions in short CPU times. The heuristic algorithm can be divided into three phases. First, we prepare the initial solution, that is, we select the services whose schedules must be modified (like visits for new users). Second, we assign those visits to the best available caregiver. Finally, the schedule is optimized using the simulated annealing method, in order to obtain feasible schedules while minimizing the time lost between visits.

The model describes the behavior of the Order Book, consisting of orders from producers and consumers only. If the number of asks or bids is not enough in comparison with the volumes planned by the traders, then producers and consumers, respectively, shift their orders in the direction of the current price at some speeds, and thereby achieve the necessary number of transactions per unit of time. Moreover, these speeds depend on the volumes of supply and demand. They must support the supply-demand balance. The paper explores the external impact on this model in the form of large operations by new market participants, who at high speeds begin to push forward their orders, for example, first bids and then asks. Such strategies are called swings. This paper simulates a single cycle of one simple trading strategy of the swing type.

In this study we model a more complex CLSC structure, emulating a divergent/distribution CLSC, where there are several end-customers and several reverse flows. Through a simulation study, we analyse two different settings: (1) a centralized setting, where all the reverse flows are managed by a single remanufacturing entity, and (2) a decentralized setting, where each reverse flow is managed by an independent remanufacturing entity. We found that by centralized the remanufacturing operations, the supply chain nodes receiving the remanufactured products are highly benefitted, showing reduced order and inventory variabilities. This benefit can be comparable to that obtained by implementing an information transparency scheme. However, this centralization may increase the correlation of the reverse flows, which in turn, amplifies the order and inventory variability to the upstream nodes of the CLSC.

However, this type of approaches does not assure the best result for an asset portfolio since assets are inter-related and resource dependent. Recent developments in the field of asset management optimization have revealed the benefits of integrating all assets in a multi-asset system. Due to the inherent problem complexity researchers rely on simplifying assumptions, such as using the same degradation pattern and maintenance interventions effects for all the assets in the portfolio. Conversely, these assumptions lead to sub-optimal solutions with a limited fit to reality. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel mixed-integer optimization model, which receives as input each asset present and predicted condition.

Most PESP research investigates optimizing the passengers’ travel time solely for some default scenario, usually a scenario where no train is delayed. In practice, however, there exist train delays that need to be dealt with. In order to find timetables that can cope well with these delays, our approach is to consider not only a single default scenario, but rather a whole set of likely scenarios. To carry out this idea and furthermore integrate the public transport problems of timetabling and delay management we extend PESP by incorporating robust optimization.\r\nIn this work we present a solution approach for the robust PESP. In our work, we apply the concept of strict robustness and present an algorithm that, given a set of delay scenarios, finds a timetable yielding best travel times in its worst case scenario. Such a problem structure can be solved by an iterative scheme similar to cutting plane methods. This approach can be sped up by solving the occurring MILPs only approximately, i.e., to a specified gap.

It combines primal and dual algorithms for obtaining bounds on the optimal solution [2]. The dual algorithm is based on the ESH algorithm and generates outer approximations for obtaining iteratively improving lower bounds.  The primal algorithm includes techniques for obtaining feasible solutions to the problem, giving upper bounds on the optimum.\r\n\tIn its original form, the ESH algorithm is not well suited for nonconvex problems. The supporting hyperplanes may cut off parts of the feasible set, and result in an empty search space. Techniques to improve SHOT’s nonconvex capabilities, including feasibility restoration, primal cuts, and reformulations, are presented.  In its current form, SHOT only guarantees global optimality for certain types of nonconvex problems, and for general nonconvex problems it works as a heuristic. The new features have significantly improved the solver’s ability to deal with nonconvexities, and the goal is to extend its global capabilities.\r\n[1]\tKronqvist, J., Bernal, D.

We compare the quality of solutions using various performance measures. Our experiments indicate the following: First, considering only one type of cost may yield solutions that perform poorly in other performance measures. Second, the heuristics in the literature find solutions that are far from optimal whereas a general purpose solver is capable of solving small and medium size instances to optimality. To find solutions that perform well on several performance measures, we propose the diameter constrained TFP with sum of distances objective. To solve larger sizes, we propose a novel branch and bound approach: we formulate the problem as a constrained quadratic set covering problem, use the reformulation-linearization technique and relaxation to be able to decompose it into a series of linear set covering problems and impose the relaxed constraints through branching.

The supplier uses mechanism design to determine a menu of contracts that minimises his expected costs, where each contract specifies the retailer's procurement plan and a side payment to the retailer. There is no restriction on the number of contracts in the menu. To optimally solve this contracting problem we present a two-stage approach, based on a theoretical analysis. The first stage generates a list of procurement plans that is sufficient to solve the contracting problem to optimality. The second stage optimally assigns these plans to the retailer types and determines all side payments. The result is an optimal menu with finitely many contracts that pools retailer types. We identify cases for which the contracting problem can be solved in polynomial time and provide the corresponding algorithms.

In times of increased economic pressure, it is of utmost importance to ensure an efficient utilization of the operating room environment.

Usually, they have several objectives in mind, such as completion of all surgeries, impact on downstream units, and over- and undertime of staff. Accurate predictions of surgery durations are essential to ensure efficient surgery scheduling. However, in most hospitals, those predictions are either based on historical average values or expert estimates. Both approaches exhibit significant shortcomings making them prone to inaccuracy, i.e., negligence of patient specific information, lack of quantitative models, and financial bias.\r\nWe present a generalizable machine learning approach to predict surgery durations for individual patients.

This effect models the tendency for customers to stock up on a product when it is offered for cheap, causing demand to increase in the “cheap” time period, while it decreases in the next. In effect, lowering the price causes demand to shift backwards in time, in addition to increasing demand as in most demand functions.\r\n\r\nThe problem is to decide in which time periods to produce, how much to produce in each period, and which price to set in each period.

However, the rules that govern the creation and allocation of new bank deposits are critically different from the creation of cryptocurrencies. In fact, the amount of traditional currencies increases when someone takes out a debt or when the central bank purchases assets from non-banks while new cryptocurrencies are generated by the actions of miners who generate them for their own profit and then sell them to other individuals. The difference of the two rules in building confidence is paramount.

A line planning problem is molded including frequency setting and passenger assignment to minimize the total passenger travel time and dissatisfaction of transferring. The Benders decomposition method is proposed to solve the model. The idea of Benders decomposition algorithm is that, if a feasible service line frequency is acquired by the first stage frequency setting problem, the remaining model is the second stage passenger assignment problem which is defined as a sub-problem. The result of passenger assignment problem, which is a multi-commodity network flow problem solved by the column generation method, can be added as a new cut for the frequency setting problem. Several speed-up strategies have been implemented to improve the process of Benders decomposition. Experimental results based on real-world problem instances show that our approaches could be a promising way for solving line planning problem of high-speed rail.", :title "A Benders Decomposition Algorithm for Solving the Line Planning Problem for High-speed Rail", :keyword2 151, :authors (62133 57015 62360), :session 765}, 2120 {:keyword1 150, :keyword3 178, :abstract "The transportation of hazardous materials (hazmat) has attracted much attention in the last decades.

In this paper, the capacitated hazardous materials vehicle routing problem (CHMVRP) with multiple customers in urban areas is addressed.

By measuring the observations of activities' behavior, a project manager (PM) can detect anomalies in cost and schedule.

Alpha, say 90% or 95%, reflects the risk tolerance of the PM. This approach may work well pragmatically, although it has two main drawbacks. First, each activity contributes differently to the project duration. Hence, instead of using an identical percentile, the PM should consider each individual activity's relative importance to the project. Second, the conventional approach lacks a cost perspective. Since the control limits affect the cost of corrective actions, the PM should evaluate their impact on the total budget to determine the control limits. These points of view suggest a new approach within which the control limits can be optimized with respect to both cost and schedule.\r\nIn this presentation, we will propose an integral framework to select the optimal control limits as well as the optimal resource allocation.

DEA aims at benchmarking the performance of decision marking units (DMUs), which use the same inputs and produce the same outputs, against each other.

DMUs with a score equal to one are in the so-called efficient frontier. Feature selection for both outputs and inputs has a significant impact on the shape of the efficient frontier, as well as the insights given to the inefficient DMUs. Here, the DEA model is enriched with zero-one decision variables modelling the selection of features, yielding a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming formulation.

Oblique decision tree building algorithms, which divide the feature space by multidimensional hyperplanes, often produce much smaller trees but the individual splits are hard to interpret.

In this work, we introduce an effective branch and bound procedure to determine optimal bivariate oblique splits for concave impurity measures. Decision trees based on these bivariate splits remain fairly interpretable due to the restriction to two attributes per split. The resulting trees are considerably smaller and more accurate than their univariate counterparts due to their ability of adapting better to the underlying data and capturing interactions of attribute pairs.

This suggests the development of a cooperative version of Braess’ paradox, in which the players are the resources (e.g., the arcs in the network), and the importance of each player is measured by its Shapley value. In this presentation, we describe some preliminary results obtained in an extension of Braess’ paradox to the case of transportation network cooperative (TNc) games, which are a particular class of transferable utility games. We express the characteristic function of a TNc game in terms of a suitable measure of congestion on the subgraphs associated with subsets of players of the game. For each subgraph, this measure is determined by solving an instance of the user equilibrium problem. Numerical results show that, for our choice of the characteristic function, some resources may have negative Shapley value. Hence, on average, their removal increases the global network performance.", :title "An extension of Braess’ paradox to transportation network cooperative games", :keyword2 178, :authors (35427 12557 58069 1632), :session 351}, 2206 {:keyword1 29, :keyword3 90, :abstract "Simulating energy systems is vital for energy planning.

To efficiently operate shunting yards, shunting plans are created to schedule the cleaning, maintenance and train movement activities such that all service activities of each train are completed before its scheduled departure. However during execution of the plan, disturbances occur that cause deviations in the duration, release date or deadline of activities.\r\n\r\nTherefore plans have to be robust, i.e., capable of absorbing the disturbances without a large deterioration of the solution quality. Due to the complexity of computing the robustness of a schedule directly, many surrogate robustness measures have been proposed in literature. In this work, we propose new robustness measures, and compare these with several existing measures. Moreover, we compare the measures with the results of a simulation study to determine which measures provide good approximations of the true robustness of a shunting plan. We incorporate the most successful robustness measures in a local search algorithm to compute plans that are both efficient and robust.

Our approach is based on an hypergraph based integer programming model, which can handle trains composed by multiple heterogeneous self-powered railcars. The method aims at producing a timetable and solving the rolling stock problem given a set of possible passenger trips, a service requirement and a fleet of self-powered railcars. The produced timetable optimizes the production cost and especially the use of railcars. To solve our optimization problem,  we use a minimum cost flow problem in a time/space/configuration hypergraph network. These models are used to handle effectively constraints related to coupling and decoupling railcars. To reduce the size of the generated model,  we propose a reduced-cost fixing method based on a surrogate relaxation of the flow constraints. This relaxation allows to produce a relaxed model with a similar structure, but significantly less variables and constraints. We are able to produce both lower and upper bounds for the initial problem. These bounds allow to apply implicitly reduced-cost fixing techniques to the initial model. The obtained reduced version of the initial model is then solved by an MIP solver.

This tutorial discloses the basic features of the QUBO model that give it the power and flexibility to encompass the range of applications that have thrust it onto center stage of the optimization field. We show how many different types of constraining relationships arising in practice can be embodied within the “unconstrained” QUBO formulation in a very natural manner using penalty functions, yielding exact model representations in contrast to the approximate representations produced by customary uses of penalty functions.

The framework has been empirically tested using data from LinkedIn. We observed and analysed the recurrent career decision of 850 individuals, who have worked at least 5 jobs over their career span. The results indicate that a change in decision behaviour can significantly be explained by an agent’s capital portfolio.

Network design is a crucial part of the transportation planning since often the construction of the resulting network is very expensive, and then cannot be changed, and because all other activities have to be carried out along the network designed. \r\nUsually when a transportation infrastructure is planned there is other transportation mode already functioning for which reason it should be taken into account in order to improve the mobility of the population. \r\nSeveral objectives can be fixed when planning a transportation infrastructure network among them the population and trips covered, and the cost of the new network are among the most important. \r\nIn this work, we consider two intertwined problems: to maximize the number of trips captured by the planned network subject to budget constraint and to minimize the total cost of constructing the network subject to a proportion of the travelers will use the new public network. Several variants of Benders decomposition are applied to solve these problems.    \r\n", :title "Solving Transportation  Infrastructure Network Design Problems by Benders Decomposition", :keyword2 178, :authors (13771 62276 5426 1), :session 753}, 2394 {:keyword1 178, :keyword3 125, :abstract "Most of the wine is transported in dry containers, exposing it to the prevailing temperature conditions during its maritime transport, which can affect its quality.

In this study, we develop a decision support model for the shipping route selection problem, taking into account the temperature risk during maritime transport. To achieve this, we construct a model that considers the internal container temperature information obtained from 167 shipments of wine and determines the correlation with the external temperature.

We validate this model by applying it to a group of routes and show that the lowest cost route can have the highest risk for wine quality.

Possible actions are (1) the relocation of capacity modules and (2) the addition of capacity modules at the beginning of each reconfiguration period.

Emission models in this context generally consider the 'hot' emissions, which are the emissions produced while the vehicle engine is at operating temperature, and are a function of average speed. In this research we consider accounting for the initial portion of a vehicle user's trip where the engine starts below operating temperature, producing excess 'cold' emissions, which are generally a function of trip length. We examine one method of modelling cold emissions, which requires addressing the path-dependent shortest path problem that arises with path-length-dependent emission costs on arcs. We propose an algorithm to identify the shortest path in a network with path-dependent emission arc costs. This algorithm builds on the A-star algorithm for shortest paths. As minimal-hot-emissions paths are easy to calculate, they can be evaluated with a cold emissions cost to give an upper bound, with minimal-hot-emissions path costs used as a lower bound.

In fact, another hospital nearby might have excessive stocks which could be shared with this hospital so as to save time and cost. Therefore, this paper proposes an inventory sharing mechanism for disposable medical items between two independent hospitals. We explore the value of a single-item sharing policy in a two-period setting. We first identify the emergent replenishment policy and related inventory decisions when hospitals are under no sharing scenario. Then we suggest a safety complete sharing policy between two hospitals and derive the optimal inventory decision for each hospital. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of emergent request rate of patients, the safety inventory level of hospital and other cost parameters on optimal inventory decision. Through numerical experiments, we find that inventory sharing is more economical than emergent replenishment policy. We also find that under sharing policy, the increase of partner hospital’s emergent request rate and safety in", :title "Medical Items Inventory Sharing Strategy Between Two Hospitals", :keyword2 75, :authors (31444 59143 36907), :session 671}, 2441 {:keyword1 169, :keyword3 124, :abstract "We aim to clarify how people use media in their lives and what their common life traits are.

The questionnaire was designed so that we could collect information about demographics, psychographics (life traits) and media usages. We dealt with four types of media: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and TV. The response patterns which are a sequence of response to each individual questionnaire item of the respondents to the questionnaire in 2015 were, in this study, concentrated upon and analyzed. Media classification was carried out by means of Random Forests, which is known as one of effective machine learning algorithms. We extracted several features of users’ life traits from the importance of questions represented by Gini coefficients after the classification. We adopted Random Forests to classify media usages of two years’ worth of datasets and, could recognize the four types of media with similar degree of accuracies to the previous study and could extract similar life traits.

We consider a firm that can sequentially invest to alter the growth rate of a project through a revenue-enhancing pre-investment activity prior to entering a new market, both when the change is fixed and when the magnitude of the change can be optimally chosen by the firm. We find that this incentivises the firm to invest early in revenue-enhancing activities, and then wait to invest to enter the market. There is both an option value of waiting that delays investment in revenue-enhancing activities, as well as an accelerating effect from the change in growth rate. The overall effect on the investment thresholds from increased uncertainty is ambiguous. Which effect dominates is dependent on both the cost parameters and the magnitude of the change in the rate of growth. When the firm can optimally choose the amount of the revenue-enhancing activity, we find that the firm invests more in these activities when uncertainty is higher, but the effect of uncertainty can still be ambiguous. When the marginal cost of the activity increases, the firm both delays the investment and undertakes less revenue-enhancement, but the overall amount spent increases.

The method is implemented in a decision support tool that can help planners both make the initial semester timetable and to handle timetable disruptions that inevitably occur. This is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach based on extending the model for the High School Timetabling problem in Denmark. We show how such a MIP can be adapted to force timetable perturbations and to prefer positive changes for user defined persons. By iteratively adding cuts to the problem different suggestions are found. Since the models can be quite extensive, an approximation model is proposed.

However, it would be laborious to build data interfaces between each possible tool. A modelling platform should therefore offer a generic data format that allows to more efficiently connect a family of tools and models while also enabling a common interface to all data in the system.

The numerical evaluation shows that with a small number of reconfiguration steps, an infeasible or sub-optimal placement can be repaired leading to a significant cost reduction for the energy to run the NFV infrastructure. On the contrast, making a sub-optimal placement optimal may entail a large number of reconfigurations, which may not pay off at the end.", :title "Reconfiguration of Service Function Chains: Trade-off between Optimality and Effort", :keyword2 80, :authors (61568 50889), :session 631}, 2538 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 90, :abstract "New product development (NPD) is the process of turning novel ideas into technologically feasible and economically successful products in the market.

One of the main bottlenecks in an ED are physicians. Physicians have a major impact on ED performance as they have multiple consultations with each patient. In addition, they are a costly resource, resulting in multiple patients being assigned to the same physician simultaneously to make full use of their capacity. Multitasking has the advantage of reducing idle time. However, patient switching costs, i.e., consultation setup times, increase with the number of patients per physician because of cognitive limitations. Multitasking is beneficial as long as the reduction in idle time by assigning an additional patient to a physician exceeds the increase in patient switching costs. In order to maximise physician productivity, the optimal number of patients per physician should be determined. In this regard, the application of a case manager approach with limited caseloads is proposed. It involves the use of dedicated physicians, limiting the number of patients simultaneously assigned to a single physician, and determining appropriate priority rules for assigning patients to physicians. The potential of applying a case manager approach to improve ED performance is tested by use of a discrete-event simulation model based on a real-life case study.

Multiple lots (=sub-projects) have to be produced simultaneously and flexible processing times (minimum and maximum allowed processing time per activity) have to be determined. Moreover, it has to be decided on one out of multiple alternative production routes for every steel lot. For every alternative route, a different quality-related priority is prescribed by the manufacturer. The popular objective of makespan minimization and the newly developed objective of quality-related priority maximization are then taken into account.

Roughly speaking, the Lipschitz lower semicontinuity properties measure the rate of local contraction (in a neighborhood of a given nominal solution) of the feasible set under data perturbations, while the Aubin property deals with the rate of local variation (contraction/expansion) of this set. We advance that all these properties (Lipschitz-lsc, Lipschitz-lsc*, and Aubin) are equivalent for the feasible set mapping when confined to the contexts of full or RHS perturbations.

In this talk we propose a new model where two l1-terms are added to the objective function of the arising optimization problem. The first term encourages sparsity on portfolio weights, controlling the holding costs during the investment, while the second corresponds to a further smoothness requirement that allows one to reduce the transaction costs. Indeed, the second l1-term, introducing sparsity in the differences between the weights, can be interpreted as a penalization on the portfolio turnover, thus it limits the number of transactions by preserving the pattern of active position. \r\nThe problem can be formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization one, where nonseparability and nonsmoothness of the objective function make the solution computationally demanding.

On the one hand, these collaborative environments benefit from the distinct strengths of the resources: while robots are precise, humans are flexible and efficient in complex tasks, and on the other hand, the presence of humans introduces uncertainty into the execution of tasks. This is particularly important given that synchronisation is an essential aspect of HRTs, as the resources must execute some tasks simultaneously. In addition, there is an increasing degree of customisation of products, making assembly lines even more dynamic. All these facts motivate the development of flexible methods to production scheduling, for the proper adaptation of schedules to the unexpected events and disruptions that occur in real-time. The literature has shown that dispatching rules are efficient methods for dynamic scheduling. This work presents efficient rules for dynamic and collaborative environments, automatically designed by the use of Genetic Programming. The rules are evaluated by simulating HRTs in assembly lines, considering different performance metrics.

Therefore, this contribution systematically assesses the ability of energy system models to answer major energy policy questions. First, we propose a set of criteria to compare a sample of 40 models. Second, a model-oriented approach is developed to characterize energy policy questions. Finally, the model capabilities and the policy questions are brought together by quantifying the suitability of models to address policy questions. We find that some models are very well able to answer a wide range of energy policy questions, whereas others specialize on a specific field. The representation of the distribution grid, the endogenous adjustment of demand, and the technical flexibility of the energy system are among the features, where models deliver little insight. Our results provide policy-makers with guidance on crucial model features with respect to a selection of energy policy questions and suggest potential research directions.", :title "The Gap Between Energy Policy Challenges and Model Capabilities", :keyword2 29, :authors (63290 61574 62514 62512), :session 456}, 2704 {:keyword1 174, :keyword3 65, :abstract "Our work studies the issue of the configuration of humanitarian supply networks in areas affected by a natural or man-made disaster.

During the determination of the most appropriate location, it should be taken into account that there is a risk of additional disasters defined as \"attacks\".

In the second step, this probability function is reduced in dependence on the level of ambiguity aversion of the considered decision maker, and on the amount of ambiguity in the considered situation (the state of the considered universe).

This collaboration must provide enough incentives to each participant to take part on the collaboration.  Apart from bringing economic benefits, a sense of fairness in the distribution of work and gains is needed to keep all parties engaged. However, when the transportation plan is provided by a central third-party entity, this sense of fairness can be difficult to achieve. Research has traditionally approached this issue by studying profit sharing mechanisms, in which economic benefits or resource utilization is redistributed a posteriori. In some cases, this mechanisms might pose a strong barrier for entering a collaboration scheme, making an agreement between parties hard to get. In these cases, guaranteeing a fair solution as starting point before any kind of post-optimization mechanism is applied can generate more confidence and reduce uncertainty between parties, which would be more willing to enter an agreement.\r\nIn this work we study the effects of including fairness in the objective function during the optimization phase, assuming inexistent post-optimization reallocation mechanisms.

The equilibrium is consistent if the conjectural best response of each agent coincides with his conjectured reaction function. However, such a definition doesn’t work if the number of players is greater than two (since the coincidence is impossible). In order to cope with such a conceptual difficulty arising in many-player games, a completely new approach was proposed. Namely, one supposes that each player makes conjectures not about the optimal response functions of the other players but only about first-order variations of the market price depending upon his/her infinitesimal output variations. In the equilibrium, each agent applies a verification procedure and check if his influence coefficient is consistent with those of the rest of the agents. In a case when the CVE is consistent for each agent, we call it interior (in contrast to the exterior equilibrium, in which not all conjectures must be consistent with others). As in general, the consistent conjectures need not coincide with those of Nash, an interesting question arises: Is there any relationship between the classical Nash equilibrium and the CVE?

SMS life savers are registered volunteers contributing in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases. Although the positions of these volunteers are known, it is not trivial to decide which and how many volunteers to dispatch, or who should go directly to the patient and who should collect an AED en route to the patient. Moreover, uncertainties associated with the response, e.g. the task compliance of volunteers, complicate the dispatch problem. Focusing on the latter, in this work, uncertainties associated with the volunteers’ actions once assigned a task are explicitly modeled. This is done by taking into account the probabilities of mission abort, non-complying actions, and full compliance to instructions for each task assignment.  We present a method to determine how the available volunteers should be dispatched in order to maximize OHCA patient’s survivability.

The addressed problem, referred to within the literature as nesting in terms of category, is a two-dimensional cutting (and packing) problem where irregular and nonconvex pieces of material must be cut from the hides. The goal is to minimize the amount of wasted material incurred during the cutting of such pieces. Nesting problems such as the leather industry cutting problem are very relevant in practice, but the quantity of research dedicated to them is low when compared against other (more classical) cutting and packing problems. Previous researchers in the area have highlighted that this is primarily a result of the inherent difficulty involved in the implementation of the necessary geometric algorithms. The present work formulates the leather industry’s nesting problem as a mixed-integer program. All problem characteristics are addressed, such as quality zones and holes. The resulting formulation, however, cannot be solved by state-of-the-art solvers when real-world instances are considered, stimulating the investigation of heuristic alternatives. The present research considers both constructive and local search (math)heuristics employing the proposed formulation.

This is especially true when the synthetic data is released only to a restricted audience and marked as being “fake data”.\r\nThe original conception of DP was that a DP mechanism would be designed to answer individual queries, or series of queries. This appeared to rule out the possibility of using it to generate synthetic data for which there would be no limit on the number of queries. The few early attempts to create DP synthetic data seemed to result in poor utility.   In recent years the differential privacy literature has developed to pay more attention to loss functions and some of these methods, such as the multiple weights exponential mechanism (MWEM), allow synthetic data to be generated.

This turned out to be more challenging task than originally anticipated: Although the geo-positions of the scooters can be tracked via mobile app, the exact position might vary up to several dozen meters from the position shown in the app. As this happens quite often, the initial planning might result in sub-optimal solutions, as, due to delays, the scooters will arrive late in the depot and might not be ready for the morning distribution.

In this way the fleet can be better utilized and necessary actions can be taken in order to avoid delays, e.g. employing an additional driver.

The criterion used for the emerging Multi-compartment VRP is the minimization of the distance under the following constraints: i) each vehicle can be used multiple times, ii) the loading factor must be above a given lower bound and iii) the delivery sequence of orders must comply with a given unloading precedence constraint. The last constraint stems from the safety requirement encountered in this industry to distribute the payload weight uniformly on the axes of the truck. A hybrid heuristic algorithm was developed for solving the emerging routing problem. It is based on the cooperation between GRASP and Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) techniques. The algorithm involves a series of GRASP iterations that involve the following sequence of steps: i) a new semi-randomised insertion route building procedure that determines the initial feasible solution, ii) a set of route improvement procedures that aim to improve the loading factor of the initial routes, and iii) a LNS routine that iteratively destroys and rebuilds part of the solution.

The RCPSPR is solved by Lacomme et al. in 2017 using a resource flow. A new graph flow is proposed in this paper, by allowing the vehicles to transport an amount of resource exceeding the demand of the destination activity with multiple-capacity vehicles. The extra resources transported can either be delivered and stored on the activity or kept in the vehicle to be delivered in another activity. The proposed approach to solve the RCPSPR problem with these new constraints is based on a new flow graph and on a split algorithm to define the routes of vehicles in the solution.

Inventory management is one of the most important activities in the pharmaceutical department, where several items face intermittent consumption patterns and stock-outs trigger new request processes, hence the alpha service level is typically chosen. The intermittent patterns are challenging in an inventory control perspective as they require specific forecasting methods, already used in the field of spare parts management. Moreover, to calculate the inventory policy parameters the normal assumption does not work well, so one needs to fit lead time demand to other distributions. The literature has studied this issue by comparing different distributions and proposing a new goodness of fit test. However, the existing methodologies do not achieve the expected service levels. We present a new approach which differentiates the target service level based on the standard deviation of the lead time demand. At every period the grouping step is made, assigning different service levels for each group.

The measurements are: 1) road markings illuminance for the illuminated crosswalk, 2) retroreflectivity coefficient for the unsignalized (non-illuminated) crosswalk, 3) vehicles speed profile for both sections. The visibility of non-illuminated pavement markings at night depends on their retroreflectivity, and the reflection under vehicle headlamp illumination is measured with a retroreflectometer. A lux meter is used to measure the vertical illuminance on the vehicle. The meter is held against the vehicle 1.5m above pavement, facing in the direction toward the crosswalk.

In a deterministic setting, the slowest station is the system's bottleneck and determines its throughput or production rate (measured in product units per time unit).

In this case, to avoid blocking and starving, costly buffers can be installed between the stations to limit the propagation of failures up- and downstream of the system. In practice, discrete-event simulation is often used to estimate the production rate of a given (planned) flow line configuration. As an alternative, extremely fast approximate analytical methods have been developed to estimate the production rate of stochastic flow lines without using discrete-event simulation.

A PCS can be defined as an inter-organizational system for promoting commercial services and information exchange between the port to their customers and a variety of stakeholders, such as forwarders, carriers, importers, exporters, customs, among others. The typical services of a PCS are information exchange, electronic exchange of Customs declarations and responses, control, tracking and tracing of the goods, and processing of maritime and other statistics. However, it has been argued the need to evolve the existing PCS into a renewed version, more suitable to the novel requirements posed by both developed and emerging economies, and incorporating the surge of new technologies. Such renovation should care for integrating new value-added services to the aforementioned typical PCS services offer. Therefore, we propose a new hinterland intermodal routing service to be included to the regular PCS functionality. Such service takes as input the results of an optimization model, which delivers a sustainable and cost-effective intermodal transport network.

Second, the microperiod length may become shorter than the set-up time.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these difficulties, I propose a new Mixed Integer Programming model for the Proportional Lot-sizing and Scheduling Problem with set-up operations overlapping multiple periods of variable length.

The objective is to maximise the volume of freight passing through the dams while meeting fairness constraints.

In light of these challenges, a unit commitment model that accounts for the start-up lead times in a rolling horizon approach is presented.

In this work, using a novel data set collected from an on-demand car sharing system, we empirically identify and quantify the effect of a car's effective driving range on its attractiveness to drivers on a single-trip basis, and contrast the findings for EVs with those for traditional combustion engine (CE) vehicles. We conduct three complementary econometric analyses i) to identify drivers' aggregate preferences on fuel type; ii) to show that a key attribute that may account for such difference is the range; and iii) to quantify drivers' preference for longer range by evaluating the trade-off between a car's fuel level versus the cost of access. Our estimates suggest that EVs substantially decrease the service demand (by 20 25%) and the fuel level has a statistically significant effect on the demand rate only for EVs: a 10% increase in fuel level enhances the probability of rental by up to 4% for an EV.

The goal is to minimize the total antenna deployment and service costs such that all demands are covered. The mobile antenna facility location problem has a number of complicating constraints. Mobile transceivers have a limited capacity for transmitting data, signal quality depends on the terrain and weather conditions, booster transceivers can be deployed in high demand areas, transceiver have a number operating modes which effect the coverage area and demands may fluctuate over time. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MIP). However due to the complexity and scale of the problem using a commercial solver is intractable. This work proposes a learnheuristic approach in which the integer variables are solved by a metaheuristic algorithm which solves the remaining real variables via a linear program. Within the learnheuristic algorithm the linear programming solver plays the role of the black-box reality module and the metaheuristic algorithm plays the role of the optimization module. Due to the scale of the problem the black-box is a bottle neck on the algorithm. Learnheuristics employ machine learning algorithms to approximate the black-box during the runtime of the algorithm. For this task a neural network is used.

Moreover, in contrast with other standard methodologies for exploratory description of data -- such us demonstrating the correlations of its features -- MaSU takes an information-theory approach which does not need to assume linear relations between the features, making it more robust. In addition to giving a clear visualization, MaSU also gives a solution to the feature selection problem, which is a fundamental challenge in Machine Learning. \r\n\r\nMaSU combines information-theory and network-science methods.

Generally, popularity-based caching is not a system-wide optimal strategy. Motivated by this observation, we consider optimal caching with the presence of mobility. A cost-optimal caching problem (COCP) for device-to-device networks is modeled, in which the impact of user mobility, cache size, and total number of encoded segments are all taken into account. The hardness of the problem is proved via a reduction from the satisfiability problem. Next, a lower-bounding function of the objective function is derived. By the function, an approximation of COCP (ACOCP) achieving linearization is obtained, which features two advantages. First, the ACOCP approach can use an off-the-shelf integer linear programming algorithm to obtain the global optimal, and it can effectively deliver solutions for small-scale and medium-scale scenarios. Second, and more importantly, based on the ACOCP approach, one can derive a lower bound of global optimum of COCP, thus enabling performance benchmarking of any sub-optimal algorithm. To tackle large scenarios with low complexity, we prove the optimal caching placement of one user can be derived in polynomial time. Then, based on this proof, a mobility aware multi-user algorithm is developed.

Therefore, a decision support system is proposed along with use cases which holistically address these issues making it suitable for delivery companies. The decision support system comprises of driver and customer applications to address the issues. One mid-sized delivery company performed pilot test of the decision support system in Dalarna county of Sweden. The optimized routes provided by the decision support system lead improvement up to 12.6% with no missing deliveries. However the improvement is subjected to the experience of driver and location of deliveries or pick-up. The system can be improved further based on feedback received from the delivery company and customers.", :title "Decision support system for last mile delivery issues", :keyword2 178, :authors (62570 62641 36150 36929), :session 912}, 3089 {:keyword1 61, :keyword3 98, :abstract "An essential requirement for a flexible modelling platform is a robust and simplified mechanism to exchange data between modelling tools.

Also, demand forecasting becomes a challenging task since LEVs are allowed to be parked on any designated spot in the city.

The present work deals in detail with the application to assignment models of passengers to public transport lines and rail freight transport networks. In these strategic models, simplified queueing models are generally adopted which provide delays as response to mean steady-state flow. In the two mentioned cases of assignment models the line choice is made by choosing hyper-paths that reflect an attractive set of lines. In the literature, several queueing models of the bulk service type have been suggested, but in the case of a route choice based on strategies, no theoretical model has been yet validated. Another question to be taken into account is that, in reality, it would be more appropriate to use queueing models with interruption of service in a transient state. In this paper, a novel method is developed to solve queueing models in bus stops for multiple lines and in railway freight terminals based on the efficient resolution of the corresponding continuous time Markov chain models of large dimensions and in the determination of solutions for the  transient state.

This is a severe problem that - among others - has caused the global financial crisis about 10 years ago. Against this background we analyze the impact of fluctuations in revenues from collaterals on credit risk measurement and develop a new approach incorporating such fluctuations in more risk sensitive way. Collaterals are captured by the loss given default, whereby LGD models typically assume a certain collateral value. This presumption results in an expected loss of 0, when the expected revenue from collaterals (RC=Market value*(1-Haircut)) completely covers the exposure of default (EAD). Thus, the risk of receiving a smaller amount is ignored. For heavily collateralized loans (RC>EAD) this effect cannot be compensated by realizing higher revenues in individual cases since the bank cannot claim more than the EAD. Under the Basel II accord, this aspect is covered by a 10%-floor for LGDs on portfolio level. New requirements (Dec 2017) now explicitly prescribe floors for the collateralized portion of an individual loan. Using simulation, we analyze traditional LGD approaches (incl. and excl. new requirements) regarding their predictive power for realized LGDs and present a new approach which is capable of correctly capturing the uncertainty of collateral values.

Compare the relative advantages of different financial derivatives and identify which financial derivative is preferable in which situation. The first research objective will be achieved by conducting a comprehensive literature review.

On the other hand, modern solvers are nowadays capable of high-quality solutions when dealing with mixed integer models.

This allows the model to better select contributions from neighbours in the graph and to scale it to larger graphs.\r\nA Pointer Network architecture is used finally to implement the node selection mechanism. The architecture is based on a neural model able to learn the desired tour for a given TSP instance as a conditional probability of the possible tours given a hidden instance representation.

The recent article by  Hämäläinen et al. ( 2018 ) discusses Systems Intelligence (SI),  a general soft competence related to one’s ability to succeed in wholes, i.e., in systemic settings which are complex and challenging due to both technical and people dynamics. The article  suggests that the SI  competence needs to be included in the skillset of engineers in a modern society. I take this same  idea into the field of OR. Behavioural OR is interested in the effects people have on the OR process and thus we should also understand the competences required of a behaviourally sensitive OR practitioner. OR deals with systemic problems and in problem solving one also needs to pay special emphasis on social systems and people skills. The SI competence can be measured and developed and my suggestion is that we should include it in the skillset of OR professionals. This would complement the OR skills suggested earlier in the literature by bringing social systems and people engagement into the focus. \r\nRef: R.P. Hämäläinen, E. Saarinen and J.

This has lead to many papers on algorithmic tools for rescheduling the timetable, rolling stock and crew schedule. In this paper the focus is on rescheduling the rolling stock. All existing models assume the duration of a disruption given at the time of rescheduling. However, in practice the duration of a disruption is uncertain, so in case new information about the duration of the disruption is available, the rolling stock must be rescheduled again. No information about a possible change in the disruption duration was taken into account when rescheduling the rolling stock the first time, thus it is only optimized with respect to a single possible duration. In case the disruption lasts longer, decisions taken in the past might turn out to be (very) costly.\r\n\r\nIn this paper a model is proposed that is able to reschedule the rolling stock in a robust way with respect to the duration of disruption. Even more, we are able to give a full robust or semi-robust solution. In case of a full robust solution all important trips are robust against different disruption durations and in case of a semi-robust solution at least a given percentage of the trips must be robust against different disruption durations. Next to that, we will demonstrate that robustness comes at a price and we will show what this price is for different practical settings.", :title "A Robust Rolling Stock Rescheduling Model", :keyword2 94, :authors (32308), :session 207}, 3449 {:keyword1 56, :keyword3 97, :abstract "Before launching a new product, a manager should attempt to i) set its optimal unit-selling price and ii) identify the most influential consumers to ignite the diffusion process. \r\nThe talk presents a Bayesian-learning diffusion model for a durable new product launched in a market of potential adopters who are connected in a social network with density smaller than one.

The disadvantage of a durable good that does not break down is that a consumer only needs to buy once. This in contrast with a durable good that breaks down often, because then every time the consumer has to decide whether to purchase this product again. If the consumer decides positively, the firm’s revenue goes up. On the other hand, if a product breaks down too often, the consumer is more inclined to decide not to buy this product anymore. The above makes clear that when in the production process the firm decides about the quality of the product it faces the following trade off: a high quality implies a high reputation but a  low breakdown probability so that consumers will not repurchase too often, whereas a low quality means that the product breaks down soon, implying that consumers need to buy this product again but at the same time this damages the product’s reputation, which reduces demand. The paper investigates this problem in a dynamic model of the firm that explicitly takes account of the time the product is sold and the age of the product.

We study the case where reselling land parcels to replenish a conservation revolving fund may take years to complete, while valuable parcels may emerge and then be lost before the land trust can afford them. We focus on a two time-period decision context with a known list of land parcels. Managers need to balance between purchasing land parcels available in the first period and saving budget for acquiring parcels that may become available in the second period, with an overall aim of maximising total conservation value secured. Land parcels are selected based on their conservation benefit, cost, probability of availability, and probability of resale. We use integer programming with uncertain resale income from early purchases and stochastic emergence of newly available parcels. The resulting optimal strategy may out-perform ranking methods based only on cost-effectiveness where capitals can be locked in parcels with slow resale.

Given a cash flow stream to the cash account (positive, if it is a payment to be made; negative, if it is a deposit), it is shown that the optimal control problem can be reformulated and solved as a linear program, furnishing the optimal sequence of transfers from the cash to the investment account and vice-versa. To improve on this open-loop solution, which also requires prior knowledge of the cash flow demand stream, it is shown next that the classical Miller-Orr three level threshold control policy that generates a (suboptimal) sequence of transfers, can be simplified to a closed-loop controller based on a single threshold or target level, which,  moreover, can also be formulated as a linear programming problem, for a given target and cash flow demand stream.

The computation of smallest possible set of buffers that guarantees a given flow rate over the line is referred to as the Buffer Allocation Problem (BAP). The BAP can be solved by integer programming techniques. However, although the approaches presented in literature make use of advanced techniques, they remain tractable only for comparatively small instances. This is even more pronounced when uncertainties are incorporated into the models using concepts of robust optimization. This raises the need for strong lower bounds on the amounts of buffers. Recently, a procedure was described to generate lower bounds by iteratively solving subsystems of the original line, in the particular case that no warm-up is carried out. However, the use of a warm-up phase prior to the actual production process, which is common for the BAP, poses some additional challenges. We propose a method that extends the subsystem bounds to the general case.

As a randomization technique, Lévy flights are used providing a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the CS algorithm, a constructive heuristic is developed to provide the initial solution.

This research proposes a continuous review multi-item two-layer inventory model. The main contribution is a novel approach to determine the “can-order” threshold and “must-order” point in a two-layer model under uncertain demand and uncertain setup costs.  In this system, the first layer consists of pi-containers which ship items based on forecasted demand and the second layer involves the coordinated replenishment of the items. The research builds on the concept of “(S, c, s) policy” [1], which is extended to the case of uncertain setup costs (A, a). A case study is investigated which involves the sales of products in a network of interconnected cities. The cities are modelled as nodes in a graph and the edges are weighted by transport setup costs. The cities undergo demand in pi-containers and this constitutes the input to the first-layer. The first-layer includes demand forecasting models based on linear regression and exponential smoothing performed on historical setup costs and order data for each product.

MCTS has attracted the attention of researchers. The main reason for this is due to its major success in the two-player game Go, a game that until very recently was highly difficult for Artificial Intelligence techniques to master. MCTS has predominantly been used in games where there is a well-defined end state that can indicate whether a game was either won or lose in a simulation, which is one of the four basic elements used in MCTS. It easy to see this for any board game with perfect information: the MCTS can simulate a game (e.g., the game of Go) until this game ends returning a reward value e.g., 1 if the game is won, 0 otherwise. However, limited research has been done to address the problem on how to reward a simulation for games where no natural end states are available. In this work, we propose a mechanism to handle such scenarios. We investigate how a reward can be specified based on some heuristics eliminating the necessity of knowing if a game has ended in a win or a loss. To this end, we use the popular video game of Ms. Pac-Man. Unlike other games where MCTS has successfully been used, including the game of Go, Ms. Pac-Man does not have a natural end state.

Solar cells are based on Transparent and Conductive Oxide (TCO) films, which can be produced by the Aerosol-Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition (AACVD) process. Concisely, the AACVD process is based on sequential stages. Firstly, aerosol is generated from a solution containing TCO precursors. It is then transported to a heated chamber, where the solvent evaporates and the desired film is formed. Computational modelling is crucial for the AACVD process design and scale-up. The difficulty in modelling the film formation is due to uncertainties associated with predicting the mechanisms and rates of chemical reactions, both in gas and solid phases, adsorption and desorption. Our objective is, therefore, to stochastically model the film formation. We run a series of simulations to assess the uncertainties and compare the film growth rate with experimental data from the literature. The results inform us how to optimise the input to the heated chamber, which is linked to the aerosol generation and transport models. Although our results may agree well with the limited data available on film thickness, it should be recognised that the uncertainties in the model parameters and mechanisms may compensate each other, leading to favourable model performance.

In this context, a project can be described as a network graph and consequently modelled as an integer programming problem. There are ways to implement the aspect of robustness into mathematical programmes but due to the nature of this particular problem, an ordinary approach is not suitable.

Known abandonment appears when the customer gives a clear indicator that she just left (patience time is observed). In contrast, silent abandonment occurs when a customer left the system, but the service provider is unaware of that fact until the agent communicates with the customer and receives no reply (patience time is left censored).

Uncertainty in demand is the most common. In this work, a case study is presented in which customer demands are uncertain. The company under study is a logistics service provider who serves different customers in Europe. Customers have to submit transportation requests in which they have to specify their orders that need to be collected. However, when arriving at the customer, often deviations between the actual quantities and the specified quantities are observed. Furthermore, customers are free to specify their orders, for example, in volume, real weight or dimensions. Yet, the planning in the company is made up in load meters, so orders needs to be translated in the correct load meters, which is not an easy task. This makes it difficult to make a good routing plan. This work tries to provide insights by looking at patterns in historic data. Routing plans based on initial and real orders are compared and, based on these insights, a stochastic VRP will be studied.

These goals are encoded in clinical protocols and a plan that does not meet the criteria set out in the protocol may have to be re-optimised using a trial and error process. To support the planning process, it is therefore important to evaluate the quality of treatmentplans in order to recognise plans that will benefit from such re-optimisation and distinguish them from those for which this is unlikely to be the case. In this talk we present a case study of evaluating the quality of prostate cancer treatment plans based on data collected from Rosemere Cancer Centre at the Royal Preston Hospital in the UK.

This technique makes use of speed average and speed variance profiles defined on each link, which are then used to generate a multivariate normal distribution that represents the traveling speed on every link and time period.

For both affine and finite affine approximations, we derive reduced formulations which are equivalent to the original approximate linear programs (ALPs), but are much more compact in size and therefore can be efficiently solved.

Our numerical results show that the affine and separable piecewise linear approximations demonstrate similar performance both in terms of the quality of the bounds and the policy performance when the number of servers are large. Both approximations are inferior to the finite affine approximation when the number of servers is very large and/or the load on the system is high.

Scheduling such tests, which are mandatory to approve the safety, purity and efficacy of pharmaceutical product families, is a very challenging task given the limited resource availability and the fact that a single product family must undergo multiple tests. Each week the company needs to plan laboratory tests for approximately 40 different product families, with each family requiring at least 5 different tests. Effective plans are thus essential for increasing efficiency of the laboratory and improving utilization of resources (employees/machines). The aim of this study is to develop an original mixed integer linear programming model for scheduling these laboratory tests at the company. The proposed model has been implemented in GAMS and solved by GUROBI via a Branch-and-Cut solution approach that incorporates various classes of cutting planes. The model determines a schedule over a given planning horizon by minimizing the makespan. It encompasses constraints such as assignment constraints of different stages of tests to resources and timing constraints between tests pertaining to the same product family.

The goal of robust learning is to provide for formal performance guarantees on the robustness of the trained model under stated uncertain situations/ conditions (known unknowns) by means of various regularization methods. Regularization refers to a broad set of techniques such as the addition of a penalty term in the objective function to control/adjust its fluctuations, the inclusion of constraints to learnable parameters (weights, structure, etc.), that aim at decreasing the testing/generalization error (variance of the model) while keeping the training error (bias of the model) unaffected. Nowadays, regularization techniques are being investigated where these additional terms/constraints go well beyond linear deterministic regularizers such as parameters L1/L2 norm-based regularization or their convex combination (a.k.a. elastic net regularization). These techniques include L_p,q regularizers, first-order regularizers (I/O Jacobian of the model) and regularization terms/functions that share their Lipschitz continuity properties with those of the activation functions.

The 2018-19 season consists of a single round robin tournament, that is, every team plays against each other one match at the home venue of one of them. This can create potentially large differences in the distances travelled by the teams over the course of the tournament, an important aspect in a league where a round trip to play an away match can involve more than 3,300 kilometres. In addition, as previous tournaments were scheduled manually, little care was taken about alternating the venue in which a same pair of teams would play. This implied that many matches took place at the same venue consecutively in several tournaments. In the most extreme case, a pair of teams played at the same venue for up to six consecutive tournaments. In what for this league was a breakthrough change, the 2018-19 season has been scheduled using an integer programming model. Among several other aspects, the model aims at providing a relatively even schedule of travels for neighbour teams and at changing the home venues of the matches that had been played at the same venue two or more consecutive times in the six previous tournaments. This talk will focus on the design, computational features, and the implementation in practice of this schedule.", :title "Scheduling the Argentina’s Football Superliga", :keyword2 96, :authors (32010 14317 61565), :session 862}, 3854 {:keyword1 34, :keyword3 93, :abstract "Bank solvency and stability of financial networks are a major concern for\r\neconomic policy makers.

The model is based on\r\na discrete-time Markov process with time-dependent transition probabilities\r\nand two states of solvency. The transition probabilities are estimated as\r\nfunctions of information from four different sources: (i) CAMELs indicators\r\ncomputed derived from banks' financial report disclosures (i.e., accounting\r\ndata); (ii) measures of market performance; (iii) topics discussed in SEC\r\ndisclosures; and (iv) news indicators dealing with bank-specific events as\r\nwell as general macro-economic events and policy actions.\r\nThe model provides a direct way to test the importance of the complementary\r\ninformation sources  in predicting bank default probabilities under different\r\ndistributional assumptions. Our preliminary results look promising. While\r\nthe use of accounting indicators from SEC disclosures provides good base\r\nlevel estimates, the use of complementary and more timely information from\r\nbusiness news wire and market data has a considerable impact on improving\r\nmodel performance.
