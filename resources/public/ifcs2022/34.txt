Clustering Brain Connectomes Through a Density-Peak Approach

Riccardo Giubilei

The density-peak (DP) algorithm is a mode-based clustering method that identifies
cluster centers as data points being surrounded by neighbors with lower density
and far away from points with higher density. Since its introduction in 2014, DP
has reaped considerable success for its favorable properties. A striking advantage is
that it does not require data to be embedded in vector spaces, potentially enabling
applications to arbitrary data types. In this work, we propose improvements to
overcome two main limitations of the original DP approach, i.e., the unstable density
estimation and the absence of an automatic procedure for selecting cluster centers.
Then, we apply the resulting method to the increasingly important task of graph
clustering, here intended as gathering together similar graphs. Potential implications
include grouping similar brain networks for ability assessment or disease prevention,
as well as clustering different snapshots of the same network evolving over time to
identify similar patterns or abrupt changes. We test our method in an empirical
analysis whose goal is clustering brain connectomes to distinguish between patients
affected by schizophrenia and healthy controls. Results show that, in the specific
analysis, our method outperforms many existing competitors for graph clustering.
