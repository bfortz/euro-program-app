Are Attitudes Toward Immigration Changing in Europe? An Analysis Based on
latent Class IRT Models

Ewa Genge and Francesco Bartolucci

We analyze the changing attitudes toward immigration in EU host countries in the last
few years (2010-2018) on the basis of the European Social Survey data. These data are
collected by the administration of a questionnaire made of items concerning different
aspects related to the immigration phenomenon. For this analysis, we rely on a latent
class approach considering a variety of models that allow for:(i) multidimensionality;
(ii) discreteness of the latent trait distribution; (iii) time-constant and time-varying
covariates; and (iv) sample weights. Through these models we find latent classes of
Europeans with similar levels of immigration acceptance and we study the effect of
different socio-economic covariates on the probability of belonging to these classes
for which we provide a specific interpretation. In this way we show which countries
tend to be more or less positive toward immigration and we analyze the temporal
dynamics of the phenomenon under study.
