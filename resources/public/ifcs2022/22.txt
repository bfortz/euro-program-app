Detecting Differences in Italian Regional Health Services During Two Covid-19 Waves

Lucio Palazzo and Riccardo Ievoli

During the first two waves of Covid-19 pandemic, territorial healthcare systems
have been severely stressed in many countries. The availability (and complexity)
of data requires proper comparisons for understanding differences in performance
of health services. We apply a three-steps approach to compare the performance of
Italian healthcare system at territorial level (NUTS 2 regions), considering daily time
series regarding both intensive care units and ordinary hospitalizations of Covid-19
patients. Changes between the two waves at a regional level emerge from the main
results, allowing to map the pressure on territorial health services.
