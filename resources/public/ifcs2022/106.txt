Early prediction of diabetes and identification of risk factors for diabetes may prevent
or delay diabetes progression. In this study we developed an interactive online
application that provides predictive probabilities of normal, prediabetes, diabetes
in 4 years using Bayesian network classifier, a machine learning technique. The
Bayesian network (BN) was trained using a dataset from Ansung cohort of the
Korean Genome and Epidemiological Study (KoGES) in 2008 with follow-up data in
2012. The dataset contained not only traditional risk factors (current diabetes status,
Sex, Age, etc.) for future diabetes but also serum biomarkers (AhRL, MIS-ATP,
MIS-ROS) for the level of exposure to environmental polluting chemicals (EPC).
Based on accuracy and AUC, Tree augmented BN with 11 variables from feature
selection was used as our prediction model. The online application implementing
our BN prediction system provided a tool that shows customized diabetes prediction
for the users but also allows them to simulate the effects of controlling risk factors
on future diabetes. The prediction results from our method showed that the EPC
biomarkers had dominant and interactive effects on future diabetes and use of the
EPC biomerkers together with commonly used risk factors as predictors substantially
improved the prediction performance.
