Telomere Length and Evaluation of Their Role as Potential Drug Targets

Patients with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia
(SCZ) and major depression (MD) show features suggestive of accelerated cellular 
aging such as shorter telomere length (TL). However, contrasting results have
also been reported. We leveraged large genome-wide association studies to investigate 
whether shared genetic factors might predispose patients to cellular aging or rather 
play a counteractive role. For BD (41,917 cases, 371,549 controls), SCZ
(69,369 cases, 236,642 controls) and MD (170,756 cases, 329,443 controls) we
used datasets from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, while for TL a metaanalysis 
including 78,592 individuals. We identified shared genetic loci with conjunctional false 
discovery rate (conjFDR) [1]. Heritability and bivariate local genetic correlation was 
investigated with LAVA, while target druggability with different tools, including DGIdb. 
We identified two loci shared between BD and TL: 1) lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
rs113833990, conjFDR=0.03; 2) lead SNP rs12919664, conjFDR=0.002. The latter showed significant 
heritability for BD (h2=0.0007, p=5.8E-06) and TL (h2=0.0004, p=0.006) and significant local 
genetic correlation (rg=0.78, p=0.005). One locus shared between SCZ and TL (lead SNP rs143773357, 
conjFDR=0.03) showed significant heritability (SCZ: h2=0.002, p=1.1E-09; TL: h2=0.0004, p=0.044) 
and local genetic correlation (rg=0.78, p=0.007). For all loci, the lead SNP was associated with 
increased TL and predisposition to psychiatric disorders. Our results suggest that shorter TL in
patients with SCZ or BD could be at least partly counteracted by genetic factors.
