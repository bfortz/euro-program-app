The human microbiome plays an important role in human health and disease status. 
Next-generation sequencing technologies allow for quantifying the composition
of the human microbiome. Clustering these microbiome data can provide valuable
information by identifying underlying patterns across samples. Here, we develop a
family of logistic normal multinomial factor analyzers (LNM-FA) by incorporating
a factor analyzer structure. The family of models is suitable for high-dimensional
microbiome data as the number of parameters in LNM-FA can be greatly reduced
by assuming that the underlying latent factors is small. Parameter estimation is done
using a computationally efficient variant of the alternating expectation conditional
maximization algorithm that utilizes variational Gaussian approximations. The proposed 
method is illustrated using simulated and real datasets.
