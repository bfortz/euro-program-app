Model-Based Clustering and Dimension Reduction for Multidimensional Social Networks

Social network data are relational data recorded among a group of actors, interacting
in different contexts. Often, the same set of actors can be characterized by multiple
social relations, captured by a multidimensional network. A common situation is
that of colleagues working in the same institution, whose social interactions can be
defined on professional and personal levels. In addition, individuals in a network
tend to interact more frequently with similar others, naturally creating communities.
Latent space models for network data are useful to recover clustering of the actors,
as they allow to represent similarities between them by their positions and relative
distances in an interpretable low dimensional social space. We propose the infinite
latent position cluster model for multidimensional network data, which enables 
dimension reduction and model-based clustering of actors interacting across multiple
social dimensions. The model is formulated within a Bayesian nonparametric framework, 
which allows to perform automatic inference on the clustering allocations, the
number of clusters, and the latent social space.
