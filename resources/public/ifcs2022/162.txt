Adaptive Fuzzy Systems in Economics and Finance: Evaluating Interval Forecasts of
High-Frequency Data

The forecast of the future movement of economic and financial variables assumes
a central role for the composition of portfolios, risk management, asset pricing and
investment analysis; therefore, the development of prediction methodologies is of
fundamental importance. With the recent and rapid growth in the availability of
financial information, especially at intraday frequencies, approaches to forecasting
interval time series have gained prominence in the literature, since they comprise
the construction of more informative forecasts, capable of capturing the fluctuations 
of an asset, index or rate over the course of a transaction day, as opposed to
techniques based on one-off anticipations. In general, forecast models have some
practical limitations, such as linear structure, nonconsideration of market uncertainties, 
restrictive hypotheses about the data, need for a large number of observations
to estimate parameters, and inadequacy for the natural treatment of interval data. To
address such limitations, fuzzy modeling has been proposed for forecasting interval
time series. Adaptive fuzzy models are nonlinear, are able to update their structure
and functionality according to data streams, and handle uncertainty from fuzzy sets.
Thus, this approach allows the dynamic treatment of complex phenomena, as well as
considering information affected by uncertainties, as is the case of financial markets.
These approaches have been applied to different economies by forecasting stock
prices, exchange rates, stock exchange indices and price volatility, as opposed to
traditional univariate and multivariate econometric methods.
