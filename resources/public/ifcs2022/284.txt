Perturb and conquer. How classification can benefit from data perturbation

Angela Montanari

Data perturbation has a longstanding tradition in statistics. The bootstrap method
and random forests are evergreen examples in this stream. The focus, in this talk,
will be on the use of data perturbation for classification purposes. In particular, we
will focus on perturbations obtained by random projections [1] and we will address
issues ranging from variable selection [2] to imbalanced classes [3], from data shift
to semi-supervised learning.

The content of the talk is a joint work with Laura Anderlucci, Department of
Statistical Sciences University of Bologna.

Keywords: random projections, data shift, imbalanced classes
