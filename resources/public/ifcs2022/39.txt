Nowadays, grocery lists make part of shopping habits of many customers. With the
popularity of e-commerce and plethora of products and promotions available on
online stores, it can become increasingly difficult for customers to identify products
that both satisfy their needs and represent the best deals overall. In this paper, we
present a grocery recommender system based on the use of traditional machine
learning methods aiming at assisting customers with creation of their grocery lists
on the MyGroceryTour platform which displays weekly grocery deals in Canada.
Our recommender system relies on the individual user purchase histories, as well as
the available products’ and stores’ features, to constitute intelligent weekly grocery
lists. The use of clustering prior to supervised machine learning methods allowed us
to identify customers profiles and reduce the choice of potential products of interest
for each customer, thus improving the prediction results. The highest average F-score
of 0.499 for the considered dataset of 826 Canadian customers was obtained using
the Random Forest prediction model which was compared to the Decision Tree,
Gradient Boosting Tree, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Catboost, Support Vector
Machine and Naive Bayes models in our study.
