Hotspot Cluster Detection Based on Spatial Hierarchical Structure and Its Software

With the remarkable development of GIS in recent years, it has become easier to
analyze and visualize a wide variety of geospatial data. Echelon analysis [3] was
proposed as a method for objectively visualizing geospatial data by a topological
hierarchical structure. An example application of using echelon analysis is hotspot
detection, that is, detecting a subset of regions with significantly higher or lower
relative risk in geospatial data. An echelon scan method we have proposed uses
echelon’s hierarchical structures to perform hotspot detection [2], and thereby has
become possible to detect an arbitrary shaped cluster even when large amounts of
data are targeted, which is difficult to detect by the conventional method. In this
study, we introduce the R package for the echelon analysis and echelon scan method
we have developed [1], and the web application that can execute these methods while
performing them interactively. In addition, an example of analysis using actual data
will be demonstrated.
