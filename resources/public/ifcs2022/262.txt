Algorithms for Clustering COVID-19 Data: A Holistic Overview of Current Trends 
and New Visual Approaches

COVID 19 was first discovered in China, and it spread worldwide and became a
pandemic. Since then, many researchers have tried to analyze the temporal tracking
of cases and death of COVID-19. In this talk, we focused on the predictive models and
clustering methods of the time series of growth rates regarding confirmed cases and
deaths of COVID-19. We reviewed the clustering method of time series data included
in the papers since 2020. We compared various methods extensively, including
the classic statistical methods (k-means, PCA, factor analysis, etc.), fuzzy time
series models, functional data analysis models, and deep learning models. We also
overviewed the visual approaches to the time course data and proposed new visual
approaches. We applied these clustering and visualization methods to the cases and
death of COVID-19 in each country for comparison.
