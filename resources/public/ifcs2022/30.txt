Evolution of Media Coverage on Climate Change and Environmental Awareness: 
an Analysis of Tweets from UK and US Newspapers

Climate change represents one of the biggest challenges of our time. Newspapers
might play an important role in raising awareness on this problem and its consequences. 
We collected all tweets posted by six UK and US newspapers in the last decade to assess 
whether 1) the space given to this topic has grown, 2) any breakpoint can be identified 
in the time series of tweets on climate change, and 3) any main topic can be identified 
in these tweets. Overall, the number of tweets posted on climate change increased for all 
newspapers during the last decade. Although a sharp decrease in 2020 was observed due to 
the pandemic, for most newspapers climate change coverage started to rise again in 2021. 
While different breakpoints were observed, for most newspapers 2019 was identified as a 
key year, which is plausible based on the coverage received by activities organized by 
the Fridays for Future movement. Finally, using different topic modeling approaches, we 
observed that, while unsupervised models partly capture relevant topics for climate change, 
such as the ones related to politics, consequences for health or pollution, semi-supervised
models might be of help to reach higher informativeness of words assigned to the topics.
