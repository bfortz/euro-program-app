Using Excel and R for Teaching Statistics and Data Analysis

W.H. Moolman

The presentation is about the use of computer software in teaching Statistics and Data
Analysis with the purpose of enhancing students learning experience and preparing
them better for a career. The software that comes to mind in this regard are Excel
(part of MS Office) and R (available free of charge).
  The effects of Covid-19 resulted in the teaching and assessment at many universities 
being moved from classroom to online. With teaching and assessment online the emphasis 
is more on understanding concepts, computing results and interpreting computer output. 
In such a teaching environment the use of computer software like Excel and R is essential.
  Problem: How and when to use Excel (spreadsheet based) and R (computing code based) in 
teaching?
  Methodology: This depends very much on who are being taught and the goals to be achieved 
by using the software.
  Results: Depending on the type of teaching, Excel and R can be used separately or to 
complement each other.
  Implications: Excel and R can be used at every level of teaching from demonstrating simple 
concepts to complicated Data Mining and bootstrapping calculations.
  All these issues and more will be discussed in the presentation.

Keywords: learning, spreadsheet, computing
