In this paper, two novel distances for nominal time series are introduced. Both
of them are based on features describing the serial dependence patterns between
each pair of categories. The first dissimilarity employs the so-called association
measures, whereas the second computes correlation quantities between indicator
processes whose uniqueness is guaranteed from standard stationary conditions. The
metrics are used to construct crisp algorithms for clustering categorical series. The
approaches are able to group series generated from similar underlying stochastic
processes, achieve accurate results with series coming from a broad range of models 
and are computationally efficient. An extensive simulation study shows that the
devised clustering algorithms outperform several alternative procedures proposed in
the literature. Specifically, they achieve better results than approaches based on 
maximum likelihhod estimation, which take advantage of knowing the real underlying
procedures. Both innovative dissimilarities could be useful for practitioners in the
field of time series clustering.
