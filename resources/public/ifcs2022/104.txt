Having large sets of predictor variables from multiple sources concerning the same
individuals is becoming increasingly common in research. On top of the variable
selection problem, predicting the category in which the observations belong to
using such data gives rise to an additional challenge of identifying the processes
at play underneath the predictors. These processes are of particular interest in the
setting of multi-source data because they can either be associated individually with
a single data source or jointly with multiple sources. Although many methods have
addressed the classification problem in high dimensionality, the additional challenge
of distinguishing such underlying predictor processes from multi-source data has not
received sufficient attention. To this end, we propose the method of Sparse Common
and Distinctive Covariates Logistic Regression (SCD-Cov-logR). The method is a
multi-source extension of principal covariates regression (PCovR) [1] that combines
with generalized linear modeling framework to allow classification of a categorical
outcome. PCovR is a dimension reduction method that extracts components that
explain the xvariance in both predictor and outcome variables. In a simulation study,
SCD-Cov-logR resulted in outperformance compared to related methods commonly
used in behavioural sciences. We also demonstrate the practical usage of the method
under an empirical dataset.
