Anomaly Detection-Based Under-Sampling for Imbalanced Classification Problems

In this research, we propose a new anomaly detection-based under-sampling method
called ADU to improve the classification performance of imbalanced datasets by 
effectively removing anomalies, such as outliers and noises. To detect the anomalies 
in different clusters effectively, three useful approaches are considered. Specifically, 
to detect the outliers belonging to the majority class, neighborhood-based and density
based outlier detection methods, namely OBN (outlierness based on neighborhood) and 
DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering based on noise applications) are
used [1, 2]. Finally, to eliminate the borderline noise samples in the majority class
(i.e., the majority class samples with low membership probabilities), a membership
probability-based under-sampling is proposed with changing the under-sampling rate
so that a proportion of majority class samples can be removed.
