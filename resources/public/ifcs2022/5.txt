Robustness Aspects of Optimized Centroids

Centroids are often used for object localization tasks, supervised segmentation in
medical image analysis, or classification in other specific tasks. This paper starts
by contributing to the theory of centroids by evaluating the effect of modified
illumination on the weighted correlation coefficient. Further, robustness of various 
centroid-based tools is investigated in experiments related to mouth localization 
in non-standardized facial images or classification of high-dimensional data in
a matched pairs design. The most robust results are obtained if the sparse centroid
based method for supervised learning is accompanied with an intrinsic variable
selection. Robustness, sparsity, and energy-efficient computation turn out not to
contradict the requirement on the optimal performance of the centroids.
