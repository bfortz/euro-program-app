Latent Block Regression Model

When dealing with high dimensional sparse data, such as in recommender systems,
co-clustering turns out to be more beneficial than one-sided clustering, even if one
is interested in clustering along one dimension only. Thereby, co-clusterwise is a
natural extension of clusterwise. Unfortunately, all of the existing approaches do not
consider covariates on both dimensions of a data matrix. In this paper, we propose
a Latent Block Regression Model (LBRM) overcoming this limit. For inference,
we propose an algorithm performing simultaneously co-clustering and regression
where a linear regression model characterizes each block. Placing the estimate of the
model parameters under the maximum likelihood approach, we derive a Variational
Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm for estimating the modelâ€™s parameters.
The finality of the proposed VEM-LBRM is illustrated through simulated datasets.
