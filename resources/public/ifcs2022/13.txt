Clustering and Blockmodeling Temporal Networks -- Two Indirect Approaches

Vladimir Batagelj

Two approaches to clustering and blockmodeling of temporal networks are presented:
the first is based on an adaptation of the clustering of symbolic data described by
modal values and the second is based on clustering with relational constraints.
Different options for describing a temporal block model are discussed.
