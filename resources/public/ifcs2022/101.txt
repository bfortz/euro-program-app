Sequence-Aware Item Recommendations for Multiply Repeated User-Item Interactions

Recommender systems are one of the most successful applications of machine learning 
in a wide variety of application domains, such as e-commerce, media streaming,
email marketing, and virtually every industry where personalisation facilitates better
user experience or boosts customer engagement [1]. Their main goal is analysing
past usersâ€™ behaviour to predict which items may be of interest for users, and are
typically built with the use of matrix-completion techniques such as collaborative
filtering. However, although these approaches have achieved tremendous success in
several applications, their effectiveness is still limited when users might interact with
the same items multiple times, or when user preferences change over time [2].
  Inspired by Natural Language Processing techniques to process, and analyse
sequences of text, we designed a recommender system that accounts to the order
of user-item interactions in a sequential framework to make recommendations [3].
This method is empirically shown to predict accurate probabilities of future user-item
interactions in retail environments, and outperform matrix-completion and similar
sequential approaches by increasing sales up to 130% in different A/B tests.
