Predictors of Quantitative Skills in Degree Schemes at University

In the United Kingdom, students are required to study mathematics up until the age
of 16. After this age it ceases to become compulsory, despite students remaining in
education until the age of 18. This means that only 20% of students on UK degree
schemes have studied mathematics between the ages of 16-18 [1]. Comparing this
figure with over 50% uptake in comparable countries, the UK falls short in terms of
maths skills in Higher Education and industry [2].
  In this paper, we will discuss the findings of a two-wave study that we conducted at
a UK Higher Education institution with first-year undergraduate students. We conducted 
the first wave of the study at the start of the university term to understand the
effect mathematical literacy has on their maths and statistics performance. Further,
we investigated the extent maths anxiety, personality traits and metacognition impact 
on their performance accuracy. Results showed that post-16 mathematics, low
mathematics anxiety, low conscientiousness and low extraversion were associated
with better maths and statistics performance at the start of the university term. Only
higher agreeableness (working with others) was associated with higher improvement
of maths and statistics performance after one term.
