A New Regression Model for the Analysis of Microbiome Data

Roberto Ascari and Sonia Migliorati

Human microbiome data are becoming extremely common in biomedical research
due to the relevant connections with different types of diseases. A widespread discrete
distribution to analyze this kind of data is the Dirichlet-multinomial. Despite its
popularity, this distribution often fails in modeling microbiome data due to the strict
parameterization imposed on its covariance matrix.
  The aim of this work is to propose a new distribution for analyzing microbiome data
and to define a regression model based on it. The new distribution can be expressed
as a structured finite mixture model with Dirichlet-multinomial components. We
illustrate how this mixture structure can improve a microbiome data analysis to cluster
patients into ”enterotypes”, which are a classification based on the bacteriological
composition of gut microbiota. The comparison between the two models is performed
through an application to a real gut microbiome dataset.
