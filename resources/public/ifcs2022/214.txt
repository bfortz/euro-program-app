Joint Sparse Principal Component Analysis

Comparing multivariate relations between different groups forms the core of many
studies in the empirical sciences. Latent variable approaches such as principal 
component and factor analysis are most useful (and used) to explore such multivariate
relations. The loadings are key to the interpretation of these latent variable models
as they express the strength of association of the observed variables with the latent
variables. Preferably variables load on one or a few components/factors only and
have zero loadings elsewhere as this eases interpretation. In addition, when comparing 
multiple groups, also a clear distinction between those variables that function
in the same way over groups and those that do not is needed: Loadings should be
exactly equal between those groups where the variables function in the same way
and unequal elsewhere. In this paper we propose a multigroup latent variable model,
called joint sparse principal component analysis, that has these properties. Sparsity
is imposed using cardinality constraints while equal loadings are obtained as the
result of a fusion penalty. We efficiently solve the estimation problem by use of an
alternating optimization procedure that includes the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) as one of the steps. Tuning of the cardinality and fusion
penalty is based on the index of sparseness. We illustrate with an example on the
co-occurrence of experienced symptoms by cancer survivors belonging to different
tumor types.
