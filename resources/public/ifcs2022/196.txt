Floods are the most serious natural disasters currently, directly affecting people’s
daily lives and causing many serious effects. The number of annual floods is increasing 
with different intensity in several locations [1]. The sustainable development of
people, critical infrastructure, the economy and society will be severely affected if
no preventive or countermeasures are taken [2]. With the goal of minimizing damage
by providing effective flood prevention and response solutions, forecasting requires
high accuracy and long forecasting time. However, recently, along with the powerful
development of computer science, big data and the development history of society, 
artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to perform this challenging
task more accurately and faster than traditional methods, as highlighted in Pham et
al. [3]. This investigation presents the application of AI in a comprehensive flood
risk forecasting methodology, with the potential to provide a useful tool for flood
management and definition of mitigation measures in urban areas, as well as for
assisting in catastrophic events prevention.
