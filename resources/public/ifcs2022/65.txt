Depth-Based Two-Sample Testing

Depth functions provide measures of the deepness of a point with respect to a given
set of observations. This non-parametric concept can be applied in spaces of any 
dimension and entails a center-outward ordering for the given data. A two-sample test
has been previously proposed that is based on depth-ranks and offers opportunities
for further investigations: Observing that the corresponding test statistic LS(X, Y)
is not symmetric with respect to the two samples X and Y, the power can be greatly
increased if LS(X, Y) and LS(Y, X) are jointly considered. Within the last years,
depths with respect to functional data have been established that we combine with
this procedure to obtain new non-parametric two-sample tests for functional data.
We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of this modified test procedure for several
classes of depths including depths for functional data.
