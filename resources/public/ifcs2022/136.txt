Mispecification Tests for Hidden Markov Models Based on a New Class of Finite Mixture Models

Francesco Bartolucci, Silvia Pandolfi, and Fulvia Pennoni

In the context of longitudinal data, we show that a general class of hidden Markov
(HM, [1]) models may be equivalent to a class of finite mixture (FM, [3]) models
based on an augmented set of components and suitable constraints on the conditional
response probabilities, given these components. We formulate a misspecification test
for the latent structure of an HM model comparing maximum likelihood values of
the two models for the same data, and when the number of possible latent state
sequences is excessive, we propose a multiple version of this test including the
Bonferroni correction. The procedure is simple since it is based on the output
of the Expectation-Maximization estimation algorithm [2]. The properties of this
testing procedure are evaluated through a simulation study. An empirical application
illustrates it through data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, in which
we jointly consider wages and years of experience after labour force entry. We show
that the proposed testing procedure may also be used as an alternative model selection
criterion for the number of latent states of an HM model to those usually employed.
