An Extension of Edge Reduction for Large Networks

Pedro Campos

In Network Science, edge reduction in graphs has been studied by several authors
for many years [2] [1]. The applications are varied, from telecommunications, to
Internet of Things (IoT), and fraud detection. In fraud detection, the objective is
to simplify the structure of networks to better identify money laundering patterns.
In most literature, edge reduction techniques are based on network structure and
link weights. In this work we use node attributes and edge attributes to reduce the
structure of large graphs, where the edges and nodes are characterized by a large
amount of features. For the reduction task we use an adaptation of Supervised PCA,
an algorithm that uses a subset of features based on their association with the outcome
([4]), but we extend the edge reduction by using a double reduction both at the levels
of nodes and edges using a double Supervised PCA (2X-SPCA). An illustrative
application of the method is made with a variant of PaySim, a Synthetic Financial
Dataset For Fraud Detection ([3]), containing more than 6 million of transactions
(the edges) between more than 2 million users (the nodes). An outcome variable -
isFraud – is used, assigning the edge to a transaction made by the fraudulent agents
inside the simulation.
