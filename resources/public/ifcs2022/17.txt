Modeling a Most Specific Generalization in Domain Taxonomies

Zh. Hayrapetyan and B. Mirkin

We define a most specific generalization of a fuzzy set of topics assigned to leaves
of the rooted tree of a domain taxonomy. This generalization lifts the set to its
“head subject” node in the higher ranks of the taxonomy tree. The head subject is
supposed to “tightly” cover the query set, possibly involving some errors referred
to as “gaps” and “offshoots”. We develop a method to globally maximize either the
parsimony or the likelihood of a scenario involving gains and losses of the general
concept manifested in a fuzzy cluster of leaf nodes of the taxonomy. Supplemented
with fuzzy c-means clustering, this allows us to obtain meaningful generalizations
for fuzzy thematic clusters of Data Science topics using several dozen thousand
abstracts from issues of relevant research journals published from 2000 on.

Keywords: generalization, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, fuzzy thematic cluster,
