Accuracy Measures for Binary Classification based on Quantitative Group Tests

Rui Santos, Joao Paulo Martins, and Miguel Felgueiras

Classification of a large number of individuals using individual tests can be expensive
and time-consuming. Hence, taking a sample from different individuals and mixing
it into a homogeneous fluid (the pooled sample) may be a methodology to be taken
into account. Based on quantitative group testing, different classification procedures
can be performed to save resources, although the probability of misclassification
may increase due to the dilution of the discriminant substance in the pooled sample.
In this work, the specificity (\Phi_\epsilon) and sensitivity (\Phi_s) of a classification 
methodology based on quantitative group tests are used to create a ROC curve which depends 
on the sensitivity and specificity from individual and group tests (i.e., from the cut-off 
points applied in the individual and in the group tests), as well as on the group size. These
ROC curves are applied to assess the reliability of classification of some methodologies based 
on quantitative group tests. The results were computed by simulation using populations with 106
individuals, different distributions for the discriminant substance (Gaussian, Weibull, Pareto, 
Levy, among others) setting different measures for the quality of the individual tests \Phi_s = 
\Phi_\epsilon \in {0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7}, prevalence rates p \in {0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 
0.1} and group sizes n \in {2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}. In some cases, it is possible to almost maintain 
the accuracy of the individual test and achieve a significant gain in efficiency.
