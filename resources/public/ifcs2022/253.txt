Correlation-Based Iterative Clustering Methods for Time Course Data

Many pragmatic clustering methods have been developed to group data vectors or
objects into clusters so that the objects in one cluster are very similar and objects
in different clusters are distinct based on some similarity measure. The availability
of time course data has motivated researchers to develop methods, such as mixture
and mixed-effects modelling approaches, that incorporate the temporal information
contained in the shape of the trajectory of the data. However, there is still a need for
the development of time-course clustering methods that can adequately deal with
inhomogeneous clusters (some clusters are quite large and others are quite small).
  We propose two such methods, hierarchical clustering (IHC) and iterative
pairwise-correlation clustering (IPC). We evaluate and compare the proposed methods to 
the Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) and the generalised mixed-effects model (GMM) using 
simulation studies and an application to a time course gene expression data set from a 
study containing human subjects who were challenged by a live influenza virus. We identify 
four types of temporal gene response modules to influenza infection in humans, i.e., single-gene 
modules (SGM), small-size modules (SSM), medium-size modules (MSM) and large-size modules (LSM).
