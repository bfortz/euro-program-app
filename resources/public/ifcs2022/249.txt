Transformation Mixture Modeling for Skewed Data Groups with Heavy Tails

Gaussian mixture models have been the most popular mixtures in literature over
years. However, the validity of the normality assumption for individual groups is
often violated. In such cases, distributions that can model skewness as well as heavy
tail behavior are often chosen as mixture components. The proposed contaminated
transformation mixture model employs the idea of transformations to symmetry and
can effectively model skewness, heavy tails, and scatter in data. A model selection
algorithm is proposed to find models that perform well in terms of the data fit but
involve fewer parameters. The utility of the methodology is illustrated on simulated
and classification data sets.
