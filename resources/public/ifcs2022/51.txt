The main purpose of this work is to know the perceptions of bank employees on the
main motivational factors in the organizational context. Data analysis was performed
based on Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CatPCA) and some agglomerative 
hierarchical clustering algorithms from VL parametrical family, applied to the
items that aim to assess the aspects most valued by bankers. The CatPCA allowed
to extract four principal components which explain almost 70% of the total data
variance. The dendrograms provided by the hierarchical clustering algorithms over
the same data, exhibit four main branches, which are associated with different main
motivational factors. Moreover, CatPCA and clustering results show an important
correspondence concerning the main motivations in this sector.

Keywords: leadership, welfare, motivational factors, catpca, cluster analysis .
