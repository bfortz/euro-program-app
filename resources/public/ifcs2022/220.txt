Conditional Gaussian Mixture Modeling

Volodymyr Melnykov and Yang Wang

Due to a potentially high number of parameters, finite mixture models are often at
the risk of overparameterization even for a relatively low number of components.
This can lead to overfitting and result in mixture order underestimation. One of
the most popular approaches to alleviate this issue is to reduce the number of
parameters by considering parsimonious models. The vast majority of techniques
in this area focus on the reparameterization of covariance matrices associated with
mixture components. We propose an alternative approach that shows great modeling
flexibility. The utility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on simulated as
well as well-known classification data sets.
