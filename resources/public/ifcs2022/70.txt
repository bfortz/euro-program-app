Experience sampling methodology is increasingly used in the social sciences to
analyze individuals’ emotions, thoughts and behaviors in everyday-life. The resulting 
intensive longitudinal data is often analyzed with the objective to describe the 
inter-individual differences that are present within it. To accommodate inter-individual 
differences to a greater extent than previously possible, a mixture multilevel 
vector-autoregressive model is proposed. This model combines a mixture model at level 2 
(individual level) with a multilevel vector-autoregressive model [1] that describes the 
dynamic fluctuations present at level 1 (time-point level). This exploratory model identifies 
mixture components of individuals who exhibit similar overall means, autoregressions, and 
cross-regressions. Within each mixture component, multilevel coefficients allow additionally 
for within-component variation on these vector-autoregressive coefficients. The advantage of 
exploratory identifying mixture components and accounting for within-component variation is 
demonstrated on data from the COGITO study. This data contains samples of individuals from
disparate age groups of over 100 individuals each.
