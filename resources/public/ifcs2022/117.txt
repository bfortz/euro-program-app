In many statistical methods, distance plays an important role. For instance, data 
visualization, classification and clustering methods require quantification of 
distances among objects. How to define such distance depends on the nature of the 
data and/or problem at hand. For distance between numerical variables, in particular 
in multivariate contexts, there exist many definitions that depend on the actual observed
differences between values. It is worth underlining that often it is necessary to rescale
the variables before computing the distances. Many distance functions exist for numerical 
variables, see [2] for a detailed list. For categorical data, defining a distance
is even more complex as the nature of such data prohibits straightforward arithmetic
operations. Specific measures therefore need to be introduced that can be used to
describe or study structure and/or relationships in the categorical data. In this paper,
we introduce a general framework that allows an efficient and transparent implementation 
for distance between categorical variables. We show that several existing distances (for 
example a distance measure proposed by Ahmad and Dey [1] that incorporates association among 
variables) can be incorporated into the framework. Moreover, our framework quite naturally 
leads to the introduction of new distance formulations as well.
