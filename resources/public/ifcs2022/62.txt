Learning from data streams is a hot topic in machine learning and data mining.
We describe our recent work on emerging issues related to learning from data
streams. We discuss two quite different problems. The first use case is an application
of data stream techniques to fraud detection. We propose an algorithm for the
interconnected by-pass fraud problem. This real-world problem requires processing
high-speed telecommunications data and providing fraud alarms in real-time. The
proposed solution clearly illustrates the need for online data stream processing.
Hyper-parameter tunning is a popular topic in offline learning. Nevertheless, few
algorithms have been presented for the online setting. We present one of the first
algorithms for online hyper-parameter tuning for streaming data. We discuss the Self
hyper-Parameter Tunning (SPT) algorithm, an optimization algorithm for online
hyper-parameter tuning from non-stationary data streams. SPT works as a wrapper
over any streaming algorithm and can be used for classification, regression, and
recommendation.
