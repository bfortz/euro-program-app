Copula-Based Non-Metric Unfolding on Augmented Data Matrix

Marta Nai Ruscone and Antonio Dâ€™Ambrosio

A multidimensional unfolding technique [1] that is not prone to degenerate solutions
and is based on multidimensional scaling of a complete data matrix is proposed. We
adopt the strategy of augmenting the data matrix, trying to build a complete 
dissimilarity matrix, by using Copulas-based association measures [2] among rankings 
(the individuals), and between rankings and objects (namely, a rank-order representation
of the objects through tied rankings). The proposed technique leads to acceptable
recovery of given preference structures. Application on real datasets show that our
procedure returns non-degenerate unfolding solutions.
