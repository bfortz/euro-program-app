an Empirical Catch Rule

Worldwide there are concerns on the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems. The
goal 14 of the UN sustainable development aims to Conserve and Sustainably use the
Oceans, Seas and Marine Resources. To reach this goal it is required that fisheries be
adequately managed. Despite that, for many fisheries the data available is deficient
and do not allow to have reliable estimates of stock status. In those cases, international
agreements request the adoption and implementation of the Precautionary Approach.
Raja brachyura and Raja clavata are two elasmobranch species characterized by lifecycle 
traits that make them particularly vulnerable to fishing. In Portuguese waters data available 
for these species are limited despite their relative importance in Rajidae landings, being 
mainly caught by fishing vessels operating bottom trawl and trammel nets. This study applies 
the methodology proposed by Fischer et al. [1] for evaluating the performance of a modified 
“2 over 3” rule as the management procedure, after a 100-year fishing history simulated from 
age-structured operating models for datalimited stocks, using the available knowledge on 
biological parameters of the two species. A genetic algorithm was applied to improve the 
performance of a datalimited catch rule. Different levels of uncertainty on the input data 
were explored and its impact on the estimation evaluated.
