Scientific tools capable of identifying the distribution patterns of species are important
as they contribute to improve knowledge about biodiversity and species
abundance, to make sustainable management decisions and conserve biodiversity.
This study aims to estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of sardine (Sardina
pilchardus, Walbaum 1792) in the Western Iberian waters and Gulf of Cadiz, relating
the spatio-temporal variability of biomass indicator with the environmental conditions.
Acoustic data was collected during Portuguese spring acoustic (PELAGO)
surveys conducted by the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) over
a total of 19920 hauls from 2000 to 2020 (gap in 2012). Daily environmental data was
obtained for the region and time of study, particularly satellite derived sea surface
temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, bathymetry, and intensity and direction of
ocean currents. Species Distribution Models are investigated to relate sardine presence/
absence and biomass with the environmental conditions, aiming at predicting
sardine distribution in unobserved locations and for the unobserved year of 2012.
The hurdle Bayesian models become suitable since they allow to incorporate the
specificities of the data: complex spatio-temporal dynamics, excess of zeros, and
the difference between the occurrence and biomass under occurrence processes. The
hurdle model is a two-part model such that species biomass is given by the product
of these two processes. In addition to considering the spatio-temporal structure, the
impact of the covariates with a time lag on biomass indicator is evaluated using a
kernel gaussian function. Data from the west and south Iberian coasts are studied
separately due to the shape of the coast and the different oceanographic conditions.
