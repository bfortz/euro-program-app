Detecting Fabricated Interviews Using the Hamming Distance

Joerg Blasius

In the research literature on survey methodology, there is considerable discussion
of interviewer effects and how to prevent data fabrication; however, there is little
discussion on the detection of data fabrication by interviewers in published data,
and there are even fewer papers examining the phenomenon of employees of survey
research organizations fabricating data. Among them, Blasius and Thiessen ([1])
show for the PISA 2009 principal data that employees of survey research organizations 
in some countries duplicate cases to generate data. While the authors focus on
exact copies, more sophisticated data fabrication techniques might include duplicating 
whole cases and changing a few entries afterwards. By calculating Hamming distances and 
applying them to the same data, we show that - in some countries in particular - large 
parts of the data have been duplicated, and most of them have been retrospectively modified 
to a small degree.
