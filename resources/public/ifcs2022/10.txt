Three-Way Spectral Clustering

In this paper, we present a spectral clustering approach for clustering three-way data.
Three-way data concerns data characterized by three modes: n units, n variables, and
t different occasions. In other words, three-way data contain a t Ã— p observed matrix
for each statistical observation. The units generated by simultaneous observation of
variables in different contexts are usually structured as three-way data, so each unit
is basically represented as a matrix. The spectral clustering application to three-way
data can be a powerful tool for unsupervised classification. Here, one example on
real three-way data have been presented showing that spectral clustering method is
a competitive method to cluster this type of data.
