Pathway analyses have led to more insight into the underlying biological functions
related to the phenotype of interest in various types of omics data. Pathway-based
statistical approaches have been actively developed, but most of them do not consider 
correlations among pathways. Because it is well known that there are quite
a few biomarkers that overlap between pathways, these approaches may provide
misleading results. In addition, most pathway-based approaches tend to assume that
biomarkers within a pathway have linear associations with the phenotype of interest,
even though the relationships are more complex.
  To model complex effects including nonlinear effects, we propose a new approach,
Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis using Kernel (HisCoM-Kernel). The
proposed method models nonlinear associations between biomarkers and phenotype
by extending the kernel machine regression and analyzes entire pathways simultaneously 
by using the biomarker-pathway hierarchical structure. HisCoM-Kernel is a
flexible model that can be applied to various omics data. It was successfully applied
to three omics datasets generated by different technologies. Our simulation studies
showed that HisCoM-Kernel provided higher statistical power than other existing
pathway-based methods in all datasets. The application of HisCoM-Kernel to three
types of omics dataset showed its superior performance compared to existing methods 
in identifying more biologically meaningful pathways, including those reported
in previous studies.
