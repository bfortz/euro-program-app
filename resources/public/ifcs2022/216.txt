Since the twentieth century, road traffic accidents became a severe public health 
concern, with deaths and injuries posing a serious threat to world health and a negative
influence on social and economic progress. One of the primary goals of accident
data analysis is to determine the main factors that contribute to a traffic accident.
This study aims to create a Machine Learning approach capable of identifying the
factors that influence accident severity (seriously injured/dead or lightly injured/no
injured), supporting the analysis of accident data. A four-year traffic accident data set
from 2016 to 2019 in the Portuguese district of Setúbal is used. Clustering, Random
Forests and C5.0 rule models are some of the techniques used to select the most
influential factors and represent them in rule sets. Results show that a rule-based
model using the C5.0 algorithm can accurately identify the most relevant factors
describing road accident severity. Factors such as accidents involving motorcycles
and pedestrian running over are the most prominent factors in our data.
