Optimized Symbolic Correspondence Analysis for Multi-Valued Variables

Jorge Arce Garro and Oldemar Rodríguez Rojas

In this paper, we propose an Optimized Correspondence Factorial Analysis (OCFA)
method to analyze a data table with set-valued symbolic variables. This is an 
extension of Symbolic Correspondence Factorial Analysis (SCFA). OCFA is a combination 
between Symbolic Correspondence Factorial Analysis, based on an interval contingency 
data table and integer optimization. The idea is to choose the best matrix of integer 
values inside the interval contingency data table. We are interested in studying two 
different objective functions: the first one search to minimize the distance between 
projections and the original points, while the second one search to maximize the 
explained variance. To solve these problems, we generalize the concepts of row and column 
profiles to interval row and interval column profiles, respectively. Further, we propose 
two theorems to find the coordinates of the interval contingency table in the factorial axes. 
All of the methods proposed in this paper can be executed in the RSDA package, developed in R 
that can be downloaded from CRAN.
