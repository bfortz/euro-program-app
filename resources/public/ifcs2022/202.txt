Functional Random Forest for Biomedical Signals Classification 
and Interpretative Tools

F. Maturo and R. Verde

This study deals with tree-based techniques and functional data analysis (FDA)
[1] for supervised classification of curves representing high-dimensional 
biomedical data recorded over time. Recently [3] proposed Functional Classification Trees
(FCTs) and Functional Random Forest (FRF) [2] using b-spline representation and
the Functional Principal Components Decomposition (FPCD) as possible basis transformation 
to obtain features from curves for training the classifiers. In our proposal,
an original contribution is also given by new interpretative tools of the functional
classification rules in the functional framework. Applications on ECG data have
shown the effectiveness of the proposed functional classifiers in terms of accuracy
and their usefulness in terms of interpretability.
