Group Lasso Penalty for Spatially Clustered Coefficient Regression

Spatial data has variables with location information. One of the main purposes of
spatial data analysis is to explain the relationships between objective variables and
covariates according to this location information. Geographically weighted 
regression (GWR) [1] is a method that allows regression coefficients to vary by location.
However, Li and Sang [3] showed that GWR can lead to numerical instability in estimations 
at locations with few surrounding observation points. They then proposed
spatially clustered coefficients (SCC) regression using the fused lasso penalty. SCC
enables the regression coefficients to be estimated with greater numerical stability
than in GWR.
  However, these methods do not assume groups among the covariates. The results
hence tend to be difficult to interpret.
  Herein, we propose a method that combines SCC and the group lasso penalty [2].
The proposed method makes it easier for regression coefficients to be the same at
nearby locations while facilitating interpretation by selecting covariates on a 
groupby-group basis.
