Analyzing the Evolution of EU Countries and Indicators of Europe 2020 Agenda

Adelaide Figueiredo and Fernanda Figueiredo

In this study we analyze the evolution of the European Union countries and of some
indicators of Europa 2020 agenda in the following areas: Employment, Education,
Research and Development, Poverty and Social Exclusion, and Climate Change and
Energy. More precisely, we collected data from Pordata during the period 2010-
2019 on the following indicators: employment rate; early leavers from education and
training rate; population, aged 30 to 34, with higher education; expenditure on R&D
as % of GDP; population at risk of poverty; greenhouse gas emissions; renewable
energy consumption; primary energy consumption; final energy consumption.
We start with a preliminary data analysis, and some countries appear as outliers in
some of the variables and for some years of the period, which would be expected.
However, we highlight that Luxembourg is a severe outlier and had to be discarded
from the analysis to allow a better comparison and differentiation of the other
countries. Additionally, as we do not have all the target values for the United Kingdom
and for the variable population at risk of poverty, we did not consider this country
and variable in the further multivariate analysis. We applied the Statis methodology,
developed in [1] and [2], to analyze the evolution of the European countries and of
the indicators referred above, during the period 2010-2019. The trajectories of the
countries and of the variables under study along the period 2010-2019 help us to
understand how the Europe 2020 strategy is being achieved.
