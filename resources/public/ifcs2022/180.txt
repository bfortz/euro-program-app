Digital Development and Internet Use in the European Union Countries

Fernanda Figueiredo and Adelaide Figueiredo

In this study we analyze how people from the European Union countries are prepared
to work and use in their lives the digital technologies. It is also interesting to know
whether the least developed countries are close or quite distant from the others in
this way to the digital.
  We considered some variables associated with digital skills, digital economy
and digital society, and collected the data from Eurostat database during the period
2010-2020. To analyze the data, we applied a Double Principal Component Analysis
(DPCA), a method of multivariate data analysis introduced in Bouroche [1] to analyze
three-way data with quantitative variables. We considered six different data tables,
corresponding to the years 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020, with the same
countries and variables. As the UK does not belong to the EU countries in 2020,
and all the tables must have the same countries to apply a DPCA, we considered the
values obtained in 2019 for the UK to include it in the analysis.
  The results allow to identify the differences and similarities between countries
and variables along the period of time 2010-2020, more precisely, to study the 
evolution trends of the countries and the evolution of the relations between the 
different variables.
