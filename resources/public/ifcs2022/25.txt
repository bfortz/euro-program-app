Fuzzy Clustering by Hyperbolic Smoothing

David Mas´ıs, Esteban Segura, Javier Trejos, and Adilson Xavier

We propose a novel method for building fuzzy clusters of large data sets, using a
smoothing numerical approach. The usual sum-of-squares criterion is relaxed so
the search for good fuzzy partitions is made on a continuous space, rather than a
discrete space as in classical methods [2]. The smoothing allows a conversion from a
strongly non-differentiable problem into low dimensional differentiable subproblems
of optimization without constraints, by using an infinitely differentiable function.
For the implementation of the algorithm we used the statistical software R and the
results obtained were compared to the traditional fuzzy C–means method, proposed
by Bezdek [1].
