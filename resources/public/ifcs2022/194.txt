High-Dimensional Linear Regression Estimation

Mauro Iannuzzi and Matteo Farnè

The least square solution for the estimation of the parameters in a multiple linear
regression model is not unique when the number of variables is larger than the number 
of units and can be very inaccurate when the number of units is larger than the
number of variables, but the covariate space is high-dimensional.
  In [1] a new estimator for large covariance matrices is proposed. The method is
called UNALCE (UNshrunk ALgebric Covariance Estimator) and is based on the
decomposition of the high-dimensional covariance matrix into the sum of a low rank
(L) and a sparse (S) component.
  In this poster the effect of different covariance estimators on the statistical 
properties of the estimates of the regression coefficients in a multiple linear regression
model is assessed through a wide simulation study.
  The goal is to test whether, if appropriately optimized, UNALCE is able to
increase the accuracy in estimation, given a high-dimensional context. The results
are compared with the standard least squares one (when feasible), with the RIDGE
[2] and with ALCE (a variant of UNALCE that stops before the unshrinkage step).
