Depth-Based Classifiers for Partially Observed Functional Data

Partially observed functional data are frequently encountered in applications and are
the object of an increasing interest by the literature. We here address the problem
of classification in the context of partially observed functional data based on Depth
to-Depth classifiers [1]. To do that, we propose an integrated functional depth for
partially observed functional data [2], dealing with the very challenging case where
partial observability can occur systematically on any observation of the functional
dataset. In particular, differently from many techniques for partially observed 
functional data, we do not request that some functional datum is fully observed, nor 
we require that a common domain exist, where all of the functional data are recorded.
Because of this, our proposal can also be used in those frequent situations where
reconstructions methods and other techniques for partially observed functional data
are inapplicable. By means of simulation studies, we demonstrate the very good
performances of the proposed depth on finite samples. We illustrate our proposal
with a classification problem with data obtained from medical imaging.
