Model Based Clustering of Functional Data with Mild Outliers

Cristina Anton and Iain Smith

We propose a procedure, called CFunHDDC, for clustering functional data with
mild outliers which combines two existing clustering methods: the functional high
dimensional data clustering (FunHDDC) [1] and the contaminated normal mixture
(CNmixt) [2] method for multivariate data. We adapt the FunHDDC approach to data
with mild outliers by considering a mixture of multivariate contaminated normal
distributions. To fit the functional data in group-specific functional subspaces we
extend the parsimonious models considered in FunHDDC, and we estimate the
model parameters using an expectation-conditional maximization algorithm (ECM).
The performance of the proposed method is illustrated for simulated and real-world
functional data, and CFunHDDC outperforms FunHDDC when applied to functional
data with outliers.
