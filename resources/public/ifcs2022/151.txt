Some Descriptive Statistics of Aggregated Symbolic Data

When we have a huge amount of data, we sometimes are interested in comparing meaningful 
groups of data, not individual observations. Aggregated symbolic data (ASD) expresses 
a group of observations that have continuous and categorical variables by using up to 
second moments of variables. ASD for a group of data is equivalent to the set of means, 
variances, and correlations for continuous variables, Burt matrix for categorical variables, 
and means of a continuous variable against one value of a categorical variable. 
As ASD for many categorical variables is still complicated, it is preferable to have simple 
measures of location and dispersion for a categorical variable, and a measure of the correlation 
between two categorical and/or continuous variables. We propose such measures by specifying 
appropriate scores to categorical values. They are compared with measures that are defined as
extensions of the polychoric correlation coefficient [1].
