Variational Autoencoder with Gamma Mixture for Clustering Right-Skewed Data

Jinwon Heo and Jangsun Baek

Generative models such as generative adversarial network (GAN), autoencoder (AE),
and variational autoencoder (VAE) enable model-based clustering to be undertaken
because they can learn and extract significant features from data. Among them, variational
autoencoder with deep embedding (VaDE) is an unsupervised clustering
method proposed within the VAE framework by assuming Gaussian distribution
for both the marginal distribution of the latent feature vector and the conditional
distribution of data given the latent vector. Several analyses of many real microarray
datasets have suggested that the empirical distribution of gene expression levels
is approximately right-skewed like log-normal with some extreme values depending
on the biological samples under investigation. Therefore, the above approach
is sensitive to both non-normality of the data and extreme expression levels. We
propose a new VAE approach based on gamma mixture that efficiently fits data
with right-skewed distribution. We derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and
optimize the ELBO using the reparameterization trick for gamma distribution and
Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes estimator. The proposed method is applied to
some high-dimensional real gene expression datasets and single-cell RNA-seq data
with small sample sizes and shows its better performance over the existing generative
models including statistical model-based method such as mixtures of common
t-factor analyzers.
