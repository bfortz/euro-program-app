A clusterwise regression method for distributional data

This work deals with a cluster-wise regression method for distributional data. The set
of objects to be clustered are described by distributional variables {Y, X_1, . . . , X_p},
with Y the response variable and X_j´s the predictors. Each object is represented by
p + 1 probability functions, or empirical ones. Our proposal is based on a K-means
clustering type-algorithm, where the centroid of the clusters are represented by linear
regression models and the objects are assigned to the clusters according to minimum
sum of squared errors. [1] and [2] proposed two regression models for distributional
data based on a Non Linear Least Squared method and on the Wasserstein metric in a
linear space. The constrain of non-negativity were imposed to guarantee the outcome
is still a distributional variable. In consideration of the most recent developments
in distributional data analysis (DDA), we introduce a transformation of the qf’s in
quantile density functions [3], which allows to map density functions in an Hilbert
space and overcome some challenge in DDA. Applications on synthetic and real data
have corroborated the new method.
