COVID-19 Pandemic: A Methodological Model for the Analysis of Government’s Preventing
Measures and Health Data Records

Theodore Chadjipadelis and Sofia Magopoulou

The study aims to investigate the associations between the government’s response
measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and weekly incidence data (positivity
rate, mortality rate and testing rate) in Greece. The study focuses on the period from
the detection of the first case in the country (26th February 2020) to the first week of
2022 (08th January 2022). Data analysis was based on Correspondence Analysis on
a fuzzy-coded contingency table, followed by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
on the factor scores. Results revealed distinct time periods during which interesting
interactions took place between control measures and incidence data.

Keywords: hierarchical cluster analysis, correspondence analysis, covid-19,
