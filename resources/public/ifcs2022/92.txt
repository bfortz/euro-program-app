By collecting data continuously over 24 hours, accelerometers and other wearable
devices can provide novel insights into circadian rhythms and their relationship
to human health. Existing approaches for analyzing diurnal patterns using these
data, including the cosinor model and functional principal component analysis,
have revealed and quantified population-level diurnal patterns, but considerable
subject-level variability remained uncaptured in features such as wake/sleep times
and activity intensity. This remaining informative variability could provide a better 
understanding of chronotypes, or behavioral manifestations of one’s underlying
24-hour rhythm. Curve registration, or alignment, is a technique in functional data
analysis that separates “vertical” variability in activity intensity from “horizontal”
variability in time-dependent markers like wake and sleep times; this data-driven approach 
is well-suited to studying chronotypes using accelerometer data. We develop
a parametric registration framework for 24-hour accelerometric rest-activity profiles
represented as dichotomized into epoch-level states of activity or rest. Specifically,
we estimate subject-specific piecewise linear time-warping functions parametrized
with a small set of parameters. We apply this method to data from the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging and illustrate how estimated parameters give a more
flexible quantification of chronotypes compared to traditional approaches.
