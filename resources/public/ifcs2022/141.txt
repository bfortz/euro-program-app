Testing Equality of Multivariate Coefficients of Variation

Marc Ditzhaus and Łukasz Smaga

The univariate coefficient of variation is well known unit-free variability measure,
which is often applicable. There are a few its multivariate extensions, and no one is
assumed to be a default [2]. Moreover, only for one of the multivariate coefficients
of variation, statistical tests are known for verifying their equality in several groups
[1, 3]. In this paper, we would like to fill this gap. We prove that the asymptotic
distribution of the estimators of multivariate coefficients of variation is normal with
appropriate variances. Using this result, we construct a Wald-type test statistics,
whose distributions are approximated by the permutation method. The properties of
the obtained tests are investigated in simulation studies. We consider the control of
type I error level and power.
