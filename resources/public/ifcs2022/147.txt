Logistic Regression Models for Aggregated Data

Thomas Whitaker, Boris Beranger, and Scott Sisson

Logistic regression models are a popular and effective method to predict the probability
of categorical response data. However, inference for these models can become
computationally prohibitive for large datasets. Here we adapt ideas from symbolic
data analysis to summarize the collection of predictor variables into histogram form,
and perform inference on this summary dataset. We develop ideas based on composite
likelihoods to derive an efficient one-versus-rest approximate composite likelihood
model for histogram-based random variables, constructed from low-dimensional
marginal histograms obtained from the full histogram. We demonstrate that this
procedure can achieve comparable classification rates to the standard full data multinomial
analysis and against state-of-the-art subsampling algorithms for logistic regression,
but at a substantially lower computational cost. Performance is explored
through simulated examples, and analyses of large supersymmetry and satellite crop
classification datasets.
