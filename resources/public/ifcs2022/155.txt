Model Free Predictive Inference for Functional Kriging Techniques Based 
on Conformal Prediction

Andrea Diana, Elvira Romano, and Jorge Mateu

In the last years several geostatistical predictive techniques like universal kriging,
kriging with external drift and kriging with residuals has been extended to the
functional framework to predict curve at unmonitored location. Here we present
a new approach for model-free spatial prediction for kriging methods based on
the conformal prediction. We propose non conformity measures for this class of
predictive methods and introduce a local spatial conformal prediction algorithm that
yields valid functional prediction intervals without any distributional assumption.
Practical solutions are provided to construct conformal intervals and are compared
with existing validation methods. The approach is illustrated on some well known
data sets, on simulated and on a real data.
