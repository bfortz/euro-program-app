Oracle-LSTM: a Neural Network Approach to Mixed Frequency Time Series Prediction

Alessandro Bitetto and Paola Cerchiello

In the context of macro-economic indicators there are two main concerns regarding
the frequency of the variables. The first is related to MIxed DAta Sampling (MIDAS),
i.e. some indicators are reported annually, some quarterly, other monthly. The second
deals with the need of forecasting predictions between reporting dates, e.g. before
the end of the year, and it is known as ”nowcasting”. Existing methods rely on
the alignment of high-frequency input data to low-frequency target variable by the
means of lagged variables and their temporal-decaying weighting. We develop a twosteps 
algorithm that makes use of two Recurrent Neural Networks. The first, called Oracle, 
is a Deep Autoregressive network and predicts the target variable at highfrequency 
given past information. The second, called Predictor, is Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
network and learns the relationship between Oracle’s predictions and high-frequency 
input  data. The prediction error is a weighted average of two terms: one compares the 
observed low-frequency target with predictions of both Oracle and Predictor, the other 
compares the Predictor’s high-frequency predictions with the Oracle’s ones. Our model 
is tested on both simulated data, where we know the generated high-frequency data, and 
real macro-economic data. Our results show better performances compared to classical 
approach. Moreover, we apply gradientbased interpretability methods to estimate the 
input features’ importance in the predictions.
