On Parsimonious Modelling via Matrix-Variate t Mixtures

Mixture models for matrix-variate data have becoming more and more popular in
the most recent years. One issue of these models is the potentially high number of
parameters. To address this concern, parsimonious mixtures of matrix-variate normal 
distributions have been recently introduced in the literature. However, when data
contains groups of observations with longer-than-normal tails or atypical observations, 
the use of the matrix-variate normal distribution for the mixture components may affect 
the fitting of the resulting model. Therefore, we consider a more robust approach based 
on the matrix-variate t distribution for modeling the mixture components. To introduce 
parsimony, we use the eigen-decomposition of the components scale matrices and we allow 
the degrees of freedom to be equal across groups. This produces a family of 196 parsimonious 
matrix-variate t mixture models. Parameter estimation is obtained by using an AECM algorithm. 
The use of our parsimonious models is illustrated via a real data application, where 
parsimonious matrix-variate normal mixtures are also fitted for comparison purposes.
