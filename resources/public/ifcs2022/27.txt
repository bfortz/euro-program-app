Recently, artificial intelligence methods have been applied in several fields, and their
usefulness is attracting attention. Neural networks are representative online models
for prediction and discrimination. Many online methods require large training data
to attain sufficient convergence. Thus, online models may not converge effectively
for low and noisy training datasets. For such cases, to realize effective learning 
convergence in online models, we introduce statistical insights into an existing method
to set the initial weights of deep convolutional neural networks. Using an optimal
similarity and resampling method, we proposed an initial weight configuration approach 
for neural networks. For a practice example, identification of biliary atresia
(a rare disease), we verified the usefulness of the proposed method by comparing
existing methods that also set initial weights of neural networks.
