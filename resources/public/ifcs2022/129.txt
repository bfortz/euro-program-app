Kurtosis-Based Projection Pursuit for Matrix-Valued Data

Una Radojicic, Klaus Nordhausen, and Joni Virta

A classical problem in image processing is that of discriminatory feature extraction,
where gray-scale images are naturally represented as matrices. We develop
projection pursuit for data that admit a natural representation in matrix form, where
another common data type admitting this representation is e.g. a univariate spatial
data collected on a regular grid. For projection indices we propose extensions of
the classical kurtosis and Mardiaâ€™s multivariate kurtosis. The first index estimates
projections for both sides of the matrices simultaneously, while the second index
finds the two projections separately. Both indices are shown to recover the optimally
separating projection for two-group Gaussian mixtures in the full absence of any
label information. We further establish the strong consistency of the corresponding
sample estimators. Simulations and a real data example on hand-written postal code
data are used to demonstrate the method.
