Biplot Representation of Partial Least Squares Regression for Binary Responses

Laura Vicente-Gonzalez and Jose Luis Vicente-Villardon

In this work we describes biplot representation for visualization of Partial Least
Squares Regression for Binary Responses (PLS-BLR). The PLS-BLR is a generalization 
of Partial Least Squares Regression [3] to handle a matrix of continuous predictors 
and a set of binary responses. The resulting biplot will be a combination of a traditional 
representation for numeric data and a Logistic Biplot as described by [2] or [1].
  First we describe the base methods, PLSR, PLSR-BLR and their associated biplots, then 
the connection among them. Finally we present an application to real data.
  Software packages for the calculation of the main results are also provided.
