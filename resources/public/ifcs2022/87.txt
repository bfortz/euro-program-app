In epidemiological dynamics, there are important parameters to provide knowledge
of disease transmission, such as reproduction number, generation interval, serial
interval and incubation time. Among them, generation interval, which is the transmission 
time difference between infector and infectee, is key parameter to estimate
how quickly the disease spread out. However, it is hard to calculate generation time
because the time when a person is infected is considerably uncertain. In this study,
we estimate generation interval of COVID-19 in Busan, South Korea according to
the emergence of new variants. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used
to estimate generation interval. In a simulation, distributions of generation interval
and incubation period are assumed to follow gamma distribution. As a results, we
provide quantiles of generation interval and pre-symptomatic transmission rates for
periods with a newly predominant mutation.
