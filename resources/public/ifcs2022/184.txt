Road traffic accidents (RTA) constitute a scourge that modern societies face, with
an increasing death toll each passing year. Deep knowledge of the conditioning
factors might help to mitigate this problem. Understanding the RTA location and
what variables play a role are keys to foster road safety and outline prevention
policies. The analysis of hotspots location based on RTA is the most common
approach to understand the relations between neighboring accidents, looking for
spatial significance. Herein, it is proposed that the comparison and analysis of
hotspots with the clusters defined by DBSCAN algorithm is a valid tool to further
clarify the spatial distribution of RTA. Data from the Portuguese district of Setúbal
between the years 2016 and 2019 was used and the following datasets/subsets were
defined: i) all accidents, ii) accidents with victims, and iii) accidents with fatalities
and/or major injuries. The Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was used with a quartic
function to define the hotspots in QGIS.
The comparison of the hotspots with DBSCAN results allow us to conclude that:
A) datasets i) and ii) have similar hotspot locations and there is no relation between
hotspots and DBSCAN clusters, a single cluster comprises all the hotspots, being
the other for small patches randomly distributed in the studied area; B) For dataset
iii) the hotspots are not well defined, with one exception, whereas DBSCAN creates
two clusters, separating urban areas with dense traffic, from more rural areas with
traffic concentrated in high-speed roads; C) Moreover, for dataset iii) the remaining
DBSCAN clusters define RTA in specific low traffic roads. These low traffic roads
are, therefore, the targets that are prone to deepen the studies for understanding the
location of RTA with fatalities or major injuries.
