We present an innovative clustering method, Significance Mode Analysis (SigMA),
to extract co-spatial and co-moving stellar populations from large-scale surveys such
as ESA Gaia. The method studies the topological properties of the density field in the
multidimensional phase space. The set of critical points in the density field gives rise
to the cluster tree, a hierarchical structure in which leaves correspond to modes of
the density function. Typically, however, non-parametric density estimation methods
lead to an over-clustering of the input data. We propose an interpretable cluster tree
pruning strategy by determining minimum energy paths between pairs of neighboring modes 
directly in the input space. We test for deviations from unimodality along these paths, 
which provides a measure of significance for each pair of clusters.
  We apply SigMA to Gaia data of the closest young stellar association to Earth,
Scorpio-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), and find 48 co-moving clusters in Sco-Cen. These
clusters are independently validated using astrophysical knowledge, to a certain extent, 
by their association with massive stars too bright for Gaia, both unknown to SigMA. Our 
findings suggest that Sco-Cen is more actively star-forming and dynamically richer than 
previously thought. This application demonstrates that SigMA allows for an accurate census 
of young populations, quantify their dynamics, and reconstruct the recent star formation 
history of the local Milky Way.
