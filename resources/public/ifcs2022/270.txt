Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is neural network architecture to generate
realistic artificial [2]. The generated data is typically used to learn more accurate
models. The approach underlying GAN has been adapted for other tasks. One example are 
TADGAN, which is an adaptation of GAN to detect anomalies in time series data [1]. A 
time series anomaly is defined as a timepoint or period where a phenomenon displays 
an unusual behavior. The TADGAN algorithm can be summarized has: 1. generate a time 
series that is similar to the original one; 2. periods where the distance between the 
original and the generated time series is very large are classified as anomalies. 
The classification is affected by a sensitivity hyperparameter, which is a threshold 
that defines the minimal distance between the time series for the period to be considered 
anomalous. In this paper, we empirically evaluate TADGAN on the problem of detecting anomalies 
in data from sensors of a fire detection system. Preliminary results indicate that the performance 
of the method depends on the values of the sensitivity hyperparameter.
