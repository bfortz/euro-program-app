In this presentation, we consider the binary classification of extremely imbalanced
data. Imbalanced data classification is often challengeable, especially for
high-dimensional data, because unequal classes deteriorate classifier performance.
Undersampling the majority class or oversampling the minority class are popular
methods to construct balanced samples, facilitating classification performance improvement.
However, many existing sampling methods cannot be easily extended
to high-dimensional data and mixed data, including categorical variables, because
they often require approximating the attribute distributions, which becomes another
critical issue. To handle these issues, we propose a new sampling strategy employing
resampling, relabeling, and raking procedures, such that the attribute values of the
majority class are imputed for the values of the minority class in the construction of
balanced samples. Our proposed algorithm is attractive in practice, considering that
it does not require density estimation for synthetic data generation in oversampling
and is not bothered by mixed-type variables. In addition, the proposed sampling
strategy is robust to classifiers in the sense that classification performance is not sensitive
to choosing the classifiers. Also the proposed method can be directly applied
to one-class classification problem.
