Elastic Regression for Irregularly Sampled Curves in R^d

Lisa Steyer, Almond Stöcker, and Sonja Greven

We propose regression models for curve-valued responses in two or more dimensions,
where only the image but not the parametrisation of the curves is of interest.
Examples of such data are handwritten letters, movement paths or outlines of objects.
In the square-root-velocity framework [1], a parametrisation invariant distance
for curves is obtained as the quotient space metric with respect to the action of 
reparametrisation, which is by isometries. With this special case in mind, we discuss
the generalisation of ’linear’ regression to quotient spaces more generally, before
illustrating the usefulness of our approach for curves modulo re-parametrisation.
We test this model in simulations and apply it to human hippocampi data, obtained
from MRI scans [2]. Here we model how the shape of the hippocampus is related to
age and Alzheimer’s disease. We address the issue of irregularly sampled curves by
using splines for modelling smooth predicted curves.
