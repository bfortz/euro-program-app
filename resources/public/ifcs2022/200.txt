Variable Screening in High Dimensional Regression via Random Projection Ensembles

Random projections (RP) are a fairly new tool for dimension reduction employed in
several multivariate data analysis contexts (see, e.g. [2],[3]). In this paper, we present
a novel approach based on RP ensemble for variable screening in the multiple linear regression 
framework. By employing axis-aligned random projections, column sub-sampling is performed, thus 
constituting an even cheaper way of randomized dimension reduction outside the class of 
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms. Differently from the approach proposed in [1], the method allows 
to account for the correlation among the predictors, and returns a variable ranking based on their
importance.
  We provide numerical results based on synthetic and real data as well as basic theoretical results 
that characterize the proposed solution.
