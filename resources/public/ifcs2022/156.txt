Statistics learning during the first school years is essential to provide all the citizens
with Statistical Literacy that allows them to correctly read statistical information.
While attitudes towards Statistics is a topic widely investigated at university level,
it is scarce for students in the 3rd cycle of basic education (12-15 years-old). The
well known questionnaire SATS-36© (Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics, version
Pos) [1] was culturally adapted to Portuguese (European) language and for students
of that school cycle. Based on a sample of 215 students from schools in the central
region of Portugal, a model with four factors (Affect, Interest, Value, and Effort) is
proposed for the adapted scale. Randomly partitioning the data into a training sample
and a test sample, the following analyses were performed to define the model: (i)
Exploratory Factorial Analysis on training samples, showing invariance property of
the 4-dimensional model; and (ii) Confirmatory Factorial Analysis on test samples,
showing adequacy of the 4-factorial structure. The structure of the proposed model
is compared with (a few) other models proposed in other countries.

Keywords: sats-36©, exploratory factorial analysis, confirmatory factorial analysis
