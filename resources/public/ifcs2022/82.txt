Estimating Optimal Decision Trees for Treatment Assignment with k > 2 Treatment
Alternatives: A Classification Problem with A unit- and Class- Dependent 
Misclassification Cost

For many medical and psychological problems, multiple treatment alternatives are
available. Given data from a randomized controlled trial, an important challenge is
to estimate an optimal decision rule that specifies for each patient the most effective
treatment alternative given his or her pattern of pretreatment characteristics. At this
point, optimality refers to the most favorable expected (potential) outcome if the
rule would be applied to the entire population of patients of interest. The estimation
problem at hand can be shown to come down to a classification problem with a unitand 
class-dependent misclassification cost, that is, a misclassification cost that may
depend on both the object that is misclassified and the class to which it is erroneously
assigned.
  Classification trees constitute an insightful class of solutions for problems of 
decision rule estimation. Unfortunately, however, there is dearth of software tools for
tree estimation that minimizes an object- and class-dependent misclassification cost,
in particular for problems with k > 2 classes. In this talk, we explain how such an
estimation can be achieved by means of a shrewd and novel type of application of a
mainstream R-package for tree building, rpart, via a user-defined splitting function
and a rectangular misclassification cost matrix. We illustrate with an application on
the search for an optimal tree-based treatment regime in a randomized controlled
trial on k = 3 different types of after-care for younger women with early-stage breast
cancer. We finally argue that the proposed software solution may have relevance for various 
other classification problems with a unit- and class-dependent misclassification cost, such 
as credit card fraud detection and customer retention management.
