Outliers Detection in Functional Data

The modern technologies ease the collection of massive data at high frequency. 
From a statistical point of view, these data can be considered as functional data: 
discrete observations of random functions. One of the key problems in functional data
analysis, is the detection of outliers. For this purpose, we propose a robust method 
based on contaminated Gaussian mixture models [1]. This model allows both to group 
and to detect outliers in multivariate functional data. A mixture of multivariate 
contaminated Gaussian distributions [2] is a Gaussian mixture where each cluster has 
two components: one, with a large prior probability, represents normal observations, 
and the other, with a small prior probability, represents outliers. Dimension reduction 
methods based on [3], are used to introduce parsimony into the model. An ECM (Expectation-
Conditional Maximization) algorithm is proposed for model inference and the choice of hyper-
parameters is addressed through model selection. The model performs efficiently on simulated 
data. It also helps to correctly detect outliers in the industrial data sets which motivated 
this work.
