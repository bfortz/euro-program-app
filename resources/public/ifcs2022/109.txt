Time Series of Counts Under Censoring

Censored time series arise when explicit limits are placed on the observed data
and occur in several fields including environmental monitoring, economics, medical
and social sciences. The censoring may due to measuring device limitations, such
as detection limits in air pollution or mineral concentration in water. Censoring
may also occur when constraints or regulations are imposed, such as in international 
trade studies where exports and imports are subject to trade barriers or hours
worked, often treated as censored variables. This work considers time series of counts
under censoring, focusing on the Poisson first-order integer-valued autoregressive
(PoINAR) models ([3] for details on PoINAR(1) models). This class, while being
simple and flexible, is useful for modelling positive-valued and integer-valued time
series possessing an autoregressive structure with non-negative serial correlation. We
investigate two natural approaches to analyse censored PoINAR(1) time series under
the Bayesian framework: the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methodology [2] and 
the Gibbs sampler with Data Augmentation (GDA) approach [1]. Both approches may also be 
valuable to analyse time series of counts with missing data.
