Parameter Estimation for Mixtures of Linear Mixed Models: 
the EM, CEM and SEM Algorithms

Luísa Novais and Susana Faria

Parameter estimation for mixture models is one of the main and most complex
problems regarding these type of models. In particular, maximum likelihood 
estimation, via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, is among the most 
used methods for estimating the parameters of mixture models. However, the EM 
algorithm is known to converge slowly and the initialization strategy to be 
adopted also plays an important role in the estimation of the parameters by this 
algorithm. In order to overcome these issues, alternative versions of the EM 
algorithm have been developed over time. In this work, the performance of the 
EM algorithm is compared to the performance of two modified versions of this 
algorithm, the Classification Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm and the 
Stochastic ExpectationMaximization (SEM) algorithm, in the estimation of the 
parameters for mixtures of linear mixed models through a simulation study.
