In many areas of engineering, surrogate models are used to replace traditional methods 
of obtaining data and evaluating the performance of engineering outcomes.
However, the investment in computation time using analytical models is, in some
cases, impractical (a simulation could take minutes, hours, or even days). This is
the case for the structural assessment field, where the construction of approximation
models to predict the performance by generating a relationship between the analyzed
parameters (inputs and outputs) is recommended. The main objective of this investigation 
is to evaluate a surrogate model into a developed data set of a bridge case
study. In this sense, the data set will be generated by using a finite element model
to consider structural uncertainties to compute the ultimate load-carrying capacity.
Thus, based on the data set, a mathematical function will be derived to compute
failure probabilities through statistical analysis [1].
