Assessing Common Principal Directions

David Rodríguez Vítores and Carlos Matrán Bea

In this paper we address the problem of comparing the principal axes of a covariance
matrix with other given axes. The point of view adopted is based on the problem
of optimal transport in families of location and shape, which gives rise to a very
simple relation between the variances of the corresponding components in both
bases. Our analysis includes the asymptotic behavior of the statistic involved, and
the comparison of the method with other existing proposals in the literature.

Keywords: wasserstein distance, common principal directions, multivariate analysis, 
          spectral functions.
