Identification of Driver Genes in Glioblastoma via Regularized Classification

Tumor heterogeneity is a major driver of tumor progression and treatment failure.
In the particular case of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive
primary brain malignancy, intratumoral molecular heterogeneity translates into different
tumor cell clones in a single patient, with different selective advantages, which
makes available therapy options ineffective. The identification of tumor molecular
changes at the cell level is a key to understanding tumor heterogeneity and providing
insights into the development of novel targeted therapies. With the rise of
omics technologies, it is now possible to extract from a single cell a huge amount
of information related to the cell functioning (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics).
However, these data came at the cost of high dimensionality (the number
of features greatly outnumbering the number of observations), which requires appropriate
statistical and machine learning tools to extract relevant information from
these complex molecular networks. In this work, a strategy based on regularized
logistic regression with network information is applied to single-cell RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) data from GBM patients for classifying cells into distinct neoplastic
cell groups and normal cells, while selecting the features discriminating between the
classes as putative GBM therapy targets. The relevance of the extracted features is
supported by literature reports on their established role in GBM, their significance
in the survival outcomes in bulk GBM RNA-Seq data, and their association with
several Gene Ontology biological process terms.
