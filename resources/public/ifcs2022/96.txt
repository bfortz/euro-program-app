Some Biplot Alternatives

Patrick Groenen

Biplots provide a valuable tool for exploring and visualizing the relations between two
entities, often individuals and attributes. They originate from principle components
analysis, but have been applied to many other techniques that provide a decomposition
between. The most well known biplot provides a projection interpretation: attributes
are shown as vectors in a low-dimensional space, individuals as points, and the
projection of an individual onto the direction of the variable is proportional to the
reconstructed data value of this individual for that attribute. Here we discuss two
alternatives to the standard biplot. The first one is the so-called area biplot [1] that
can be used as an alternative to every standard projection biplot. Its main difference
is that the estimate of the data is given by the area formed by the origin and two
points. The second variety is the nonlinear biplot with a distance interpretation: the
reconstructed value on a variable of each sample point is obtained by finding the
nearest marker point on a nonlinear curve representing the variable [2]. Each type
of biplot will be explained briefly and compared with the standard biplot.
