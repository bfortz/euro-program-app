We use unsupervised clustering and supervised ensemble machine learning to identify 
segments of users defined by behavioural data. Hierarchical clustering is used as
an explorative method and to identify users with similar behavioural patterns based
on their online activity data (aka click data from mondaq.com). We assess estimated
clusters by parametric bootstrap evaluation [1]. Stable clusters are used as additional
features in ensemble prediction of win-loss probabilities for potential clients. We
improve the interpretability of the machine learning model by ensembles of optimal
trees [2, 3]. Our approach is compared with several machine learning models as
random forest, neural networks and logistic regression.

Keywords: bootstrap assessment of cluster stability, ensemble of optimal trees,
          win-loss probabilities of potential clients
