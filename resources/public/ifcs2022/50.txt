The evaluation of clustering structures is a crucial step in cluster analysis. This study
presents the main results of the hierarchical cluster analysis of variables concerning
a real dataset in the context of Higher Education. The goal of this research is to find
a typology of some relevant items taking into account both the homogeneity and
the isolation of the clusters. Two similarity measures, namely the standard affinity
coefficient and Spearman’s correlation coefficient, were used, and combined with
three probabilistic (AVL, AVB and AV1) aggregation criteria, from a parametric family
in the scope of the VL (Validity Link) methodology [1]. The best partitions were
selected based on some validation indices, namely the global STAT levels statistics
and the measures P(I2, \Sigma) and \gamma [2], adapted to the case of similarity 
coefficients [3]. In order to evaluate the clusters and identify their most representative 
elements, the Mann and Whitney U statistics and the silhouette plot were also used.
