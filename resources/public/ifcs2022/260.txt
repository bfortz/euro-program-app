Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients by the Underlying Diseases and Drug Treatment in Korea

Ho Kim and Taerim Lee

Certain underlying diseases such as diabetic mellitus and hypertension
are a risk factor for the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
patients. Furthermore, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are controversial at role in the process of
COVID-19 cases. The aim of the study was to investigate whether underlying diseases 
and taking ACEi/ARBs, affect the duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients 
with confirmed COVID-19. Among the comorbidities, a history of hypertension (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.056–2.158) and diabetes (HR, 1.867; 
95% CI, 1.408–2.475) were associated significantly with mortality. Furthermore, heart 
failure (HR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.027–1.884), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 
1.615; 95% CI, 1.185–2.202), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.451; 95% CI, 1.018–2.069), 
mental disorder (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.106–2.343), end stage renal disease (HR, 5.353; 
95% CI, 2.185–13.12) were also associated significantly with mortality. The underlying 
disease has increased the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes, 
hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and mental disorders 
increased mortality. Controversial whether taking ACEi/ARBs would benefit COVID-19 
patients, in our study, patients taking ACEi/ARBs had a higher risk of mortality.
