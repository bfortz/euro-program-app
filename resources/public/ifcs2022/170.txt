Compositional data naturally occur in many different research fields, such as 
geochemistry or metabolomics. Due to their relative nature, compositions cannot be
directly analysed using standard statistical methods. Instead, it is common to express
compositional data as log-ratio coordinates with respect to an orthonormal basis of
their sample space, see [1, 3], named as orthonormal logratio (olr) coordinates.
Principal balances (PBs) are a specific class of olr coordinates, which are a suitable 
choice in a high-dimensional context, see [2]. They are constructed such that
the first few coordinates capture most of the original data variability. In this work,
we adapt the PB procedure introduced in [2] to be used for variable selection in
regression and classification problems with a high-dimensional composition acting
in an explanatory role. Moreover, hereby we extend popular logcontrast models to
consider other potentially interesting (orthonormal) logcontrasts. For this, partial
least squares (PLS) estimation is embedded into the construction of the PBs. The
performance of the proposal is demonstrated using simulated and real-world data.
