Urszula Cieraszewska, Paweł Lula, Magdalena Talaga, and Marcela Zembura

The analysis of the publication activity has not only great cognitive importance, but
it should be treated as an important tool supporting scientific activity management.
The authors’ attention has been directed to this aspect of scientific productivity
research, which concerns the analysis of main features of the network of cooperation
among authors and the identification of the most frequent patterns of cooperation
[1, 2].
  The authors are planning to:
1. identify the type of networks in the context of random networks (Erdős - Rényi -
Gilbert model) and small-world networks (Watts–Strogatz model),
2. carry out an analysis of the structure of author teams and determine their size,
diversification of institutions and countries represented by authors and lastingness
of teams,
3. study the relationship between essential features of authors’ teams and main
measures reflecting publication significance expressed by journal prestige and
the number of citations of a given paper,
4. compare networks of authors and patterns of cooperation for economics, business
and medicine area.
  The analysis will be performed using data from Scopus database describing
research publications of Polish authors working in the field of economics, business
and medicine.
