Data Clustering and Representation Learning Based on Networked Data

Lazhar Labiod and Mohamed Nadif

To deal simultaneously with both, the attributed network embedding and clustering,
we propose a new model exploiting both content and structure information. The
proposed model relies on the approximation of the relaxed continuous embedding
solution by the true discrete clustering. Thereby, we show that incorporating an
embedding representation provides simpler and easier interpretable solutions. 
Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better, in terms 
of clustering, than the state-of-art algorithms, including deep learning methods 
devoted to similar tasks.
