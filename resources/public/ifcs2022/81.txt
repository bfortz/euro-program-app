A Criterion for Selecting the Number of Time Series Clusters

Daniel Pena and Ruey S. Tsay

A new method is proposed to select the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering
of a set of independent time series, including a test statistic for detecting existence
of multiple cluster. The method focuses on the steps (height increments) of a dendrogram 
and uses simulation to generate a reference distribution of the step. The proposed test 
statistic employs an upper sample quantile of the dendrogram steps of the data and the 
reference distribution. The largest step of the dendrogram is then used to select the 
number of clusters. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed method and show 
that it works well in simulation and applications. The performance of the criterion is 
illustrated with different measures of similarity between the univariate time series features.
