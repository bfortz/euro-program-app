The challenge of deriving insights from the Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized 
as one of the most exciting and key opportunities for both academia and industry. Advanced 
analysis of big data streams from sensors and devices is bound to become a key area of data 
mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing increases. Dealing 
with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change 
completely, is one of the core issues in IoT stream mining. This tutorial is a gentle 
introduction to mining IoT big data streams.
