We present an application of the Multiple Instance Learning (MIl) paradigm to the
classification of pneumonia X-ray images, considering three different categories:
radiographies of healthy people, of people with bacterial pneumonia and of people
with viral pneumonia. The proposed algorithms, which are very fast in practice,
appear promising especially if we take into account that no preprocessing technique
on the images has been used.
  In particular we will focus on the application of three different MIL instancespace
approaches: MIL-RL [1], based on a Lagrangian relaxation technique, mi-SPSVM [2], 
which combines the classical Support Vector Machine approach with
the Proximal Support Vector Machine technique and MIL-kink [3], which provides
a separation hyperplane fixing in advance the normal and computing the bias by
nonsmooth techniques.
  Numerical results on some real-world data sets are presented.
