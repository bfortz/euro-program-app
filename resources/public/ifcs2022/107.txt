Isolation Forests for Symbolic Data as a Tool for Outlier Mining

Andrzej Dudek and Marcin Pe lka

The intuitive definition of an outliers would be ’an observation which deviate so
much from other observations as to arouse suspicions that is generated by a different
mechanism’. Detection of outliers is a fundamental issue in data analysis, its main
goal is to detect and remove anomalous objects from the data. Because the technology
changes rapidly, number of databases and their size grows over time, which makes
outlier detection and removal even harder.
  The main aim of the paper is to propose an adaptation of well-known isolation
forest methods, that has been proofed to be useful in outlier detection in the classical
data, for symbolic data case. Isolation forest uses well-known decision tree idea
to detect anomalies using isolation on the basis how far a data point is to the
rest of the data, rather than modelling normal points. The same ideas (applying
ideas of the decision tree) can be used for symbolic data. In the empirical part of
the presentation artificial and real data with outliers is used to evaluate proposed
approach and compare it with DBSCAN, decision tree and kernel discriminant
analysis for symbolic data.
