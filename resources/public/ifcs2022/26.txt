Modern statistical and machine learning settings often involve high data volume
and data streaming, which require the development of online estimation algorithms.
The online Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm extends the popular EM
algorithm to this setting, via a stochastic approximation approach. We show that an
online version of the Minorization–Maximization (MM) algorithm, which includes
the online EM algorithm as a special case, can also be constructed in a similar
manner. We demonstrate our approach via an application to the logistic regression
problem and compare it to existing methods.
