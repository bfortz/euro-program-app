This paper develops the idea of creating an ensemble of accurate and diverse trees
for improved classification accuracy: Optimal Random Projection Trees Ensemble
(ORPTE), which is an extension of Optimal Trees Ensemble (OTE) [1]. Diversity
in the base classification trees is introduced by the method of Random Projection
as a dimensionality reduction tool that preserves pairwise distances between 
observations [2]. A sufficiently large number of trees is grown on bootstrap samples by
using the Random Forest algorithm, each generated on a random projection of the
training data. For maintaining accuracy in the base models, trees are ranked based on
their out-of-bag error estimates and a certain proportion of the top ranked trees are
selected. The selected trees are integrated as an ensemble for predicting new/unseen
data. The proposed method was assessed on 25 benchmark datasets against seven
competitor methods in addition to a simulation study. The results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperformed its competitors in most of the data sets and the
simulation setup.
