Fire stations (FS) provide a global emergency response to non-fire incidents, 
e.g., vehicle crashes. Urban fires are nonetheless one of the most frequent 
types of occurrences and sources of property damage that may lead to severe losses. 
This severity is linked to the characteristic higher population densities and larger 
building agglomerations in urban centers. In Portugal, FS are very non-uniformly 
spatially distributed between municipalities both in terms of number and geographical 
location. Since the spatial configuration of fire stations may considerably influence 
the effectiveness of the provided services, national and regional governments need 
research-based advice on how many and where to establish firefighting facilities. Hence, 
based on information regarding urban and rural fires and vehicle crashes occurrences, 
this study aimed at estimating the number of FS per municipality by fitting a Poisson 
regression while accounting for spatial dependence. In addition, an unsupervised machine 
learning clustering approach was used to assess the adequacy and efficiency of FS 
locations, aiming to minimize the distance or the arrival time to the incidents.
