Although Type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been known as one of the important risk
factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19, the effect of T2D and its genetic
susceptibility on COVID-19 are largely unknown. We analyzed the population-based
cohort data of 459, 188 individuals from UK Biobank with COVID-19 test results,
individuals’ hospitalization data and death-related records during the period from
March 11, 2020 to December 20, 2021. First, we investigated the association of
T2D, and its genetic susceptibility with COVID-19 infection using multivariable
logistic regression model. To capture overall genetic susceptibility for T2D, we 
computed polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on summary statistics from UK Biobank.
In the multivariable logistic models, we found that the odds ratio (OR) of T2D was
1.555 (P = 3.49×10^(−86)) and OR of PRS for T2D with one-unit (= standard deviation)
increase in PRS was 1.064 (P = 3.11 × 10^(−12)), indicating the roles of T2D-related
genetics in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. Next, we performed multivariable 
Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the effect of T2D patients infected
with COVID-19 on the survival times. The estimated survival curves and pairwise
log-rank tests showed that the estimated hazard for COVID-19 infected T2D patients
were 4.67 times (P = 9.88×10^(−324)) and 2.58 times (P = 6.20×10^(−231)) higher than
individuals without COVID-19 infection and T2D, respectively and the hazard ratio
(HR) of PRS for T2D with one-unit increase in PRS was 1.088 (P = 4.76 × 10^(−14)).
Furthermore, we found the mortality of COVID-19 infected T2D patients was dramatically 
increased compared to T2D patients not infected with COVID-19 and the mortality of 
individuals with high genetic susceptibility for T2D was increased as well.
