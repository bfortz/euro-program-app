Latent growth curve models (LGCM) became in recent years a very popular technique 
for longitudinal data analysis: they allow individuals to have distinct growth
trajectories over time [1]. Although the LGCM specified model structure imposes
normality assumptions, the data analyst often faces data deviations from normality, 
implying mild, moderate or even severe values for skewness and or kurtosis.
In the current research, a Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted in order to
investigate the effect of observed data deviations from normality on goodness-of-fit
indices. A new approach to generate multivariate non-normal distributed data was
used: the VITA method [2]. This method is a covariance model simulation method
using regular vines. The dependency structure is determined by bivariate copulae
and a nested set of trees.
  One thousand datasets were randomly generated from regular vines using Clayton 
copula and three marginal distributions (Normal, Student 3 and Gamma). The
multivariate normal distribution was also used for data generation. LGCM with
unconditional linear growth was considered. Three time points and distinct 
combinations of sample sizes were used. The impacts of such deviations on 
goodness-of-fit measures are discussed.
