Exact Computation of the Angular Halfspace Depth

Stanislav Nagy and Rainer Dyckerhoff

Directional data arise naturally as observations lying in the unit sphere of a d-dimensional 
Euclidean space. The angular halfspace depth [2] is a nonparametric tool for the analysis of 
directional data, with wide applications in e.g. classification and pattern recognition tasks. 
The angular halfspace depth was proposed already in 1987 in [3], but its widespread use has been 
hampered in practice by significant computational issues. We address these problems by considering 
a simple projection scheme that allows reducing the computation of the angular halfspace depth to the
task of evaluating a variant of the usual halfspace depth in a linear space [1]. Efficient algorithms 
for exact computation and approximation of the angular halfspace depth are thus developed.
