Some Issues in Robust Clustering

Christian Hennig

Some key issues in robust clustering are discussed with focus on Gaussian mixture
model based clustering, namely the formal definition of outliers, ambiguity between
groups of outliers and clusters, the interaction between robust clustering and the
estimation of the number of clusters, the essential dependence of (not only) robust
clustering on tuning decisions, and shortcomings of existing measurements of cluster
stability when it comes to outliers.

Keywords: gaussian mixture model, trimming, noise component, number of clusters, 
          user tuning, cluster stability
