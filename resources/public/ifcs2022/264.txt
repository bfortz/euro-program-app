Vine Copula Mixture Models and Clustering for Non-Gaussian Data

Ozge Sahin and Claudia Czado

The majority of finite mixture models suffer from not allowing asymmetric tail
dependencies within components and not capturing non-elliptical clusters in 
clustering applications. Since vine copulas are very flexible in capturing these 
dependencies, a novel vine copula mixture model for continuous data is proposed. 
The model selection and parameter estimation problems are discussed, and further, 
a new model-based clustering algorithm is formulated. The use of vine copulas in
clustering allows for a range of shapes and dependency structures for the clusters.
The simulation experiments illustrate a significant gain in clustering accuracy when
notably asymmetric tail dependencies or/and non-Gaussian margins within the coponents 
exist. The analysis of real data sets accompanies the proposed method. The model-based 
clustering algorithm with vine copula mixture models outperforms others, especially for 
the non-Gaussian multivariate data.
