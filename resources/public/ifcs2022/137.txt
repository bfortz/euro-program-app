Many data sets have not been obtained with a known sampling mechanism and are
termed as non-probability samples. Non-probability samples are often treated as a
simple random sample when estimating a population parameter (e.g., population
mean), and therefore may suffer from sample selection bias. To correct for selection
bias, one approach is the pseudo-weighting method [2]. The pseudo-weighting
assumes that an inclusion mechanism exists and the inclusion probabilities (propensities)
may be estimated. The inverse of the estimated propensities are treated as the
pseudo weights.
However, weighting methods in general are sensitive to large variance. The resulting
mean squared error after correction may be even larger than the mean squared
error before correction [1]. A model assessment framework is needed for selection
bias correction by weighting methods. Therefore, it is important to find a suitable
indicator of model performance to evaluate the pseudo weights. Some performance
metrics that may be useful for evaluation are discuss in this research.
