Localization Processes for Functional Data Classification

Antonio Elías, Raúl Jiménez, and J. E. Yukich

We propose an alternative to k-nearest neighbors for functional data whereby the
approximating neighboring curves are piecewise functions built from a functional
sample. Using a locally defined distance function that satisfies stabilization criteria,
we establish pointwise and global approximation results in function spaces when
the number of data curves is large enough. We exploit this feature to develop the
asymptotic theory when a finite number of curves is observed at time-points given
by an i.i.d. sample whose cardinality increases up to infinity. We use these results
to study the problem of functional classification and outlier detection. For such
problems our methods are competitive with and sometimes superior to benchmark
predictions in the field.
