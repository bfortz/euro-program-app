A dissimilarity d on a set S of size n is said to be Robinson [3] if its matrix can
be symmetrically permuted so that its elements do not decrease when moving away
from the main diagonal along any row or column. Equivalently, s admits a total
order < such that i < j < k implies that d(i, j) <= d(i, k) and d(j, k) <=  d(i, k).
Intuitively, d is Robinson if d can be represented by points on a line. Recognizing
Robinson dissimilarities has numerous applications in seriation and classification.
In this paper, we present two simple algorithms (inspired by Quicksort) to recognize
Robinson dissimilarities. One of these algorithms uses partition refinement [2] and
runs in O(n^2 lon n), the other one uses PQ-trees [1] and runs in O(n^3) in worst case
and in O(n^2) on average.
