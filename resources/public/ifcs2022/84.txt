Functional Data Representation with Merge Trees

Matteo Pegoraro and Piercesare Secchi

Topological Data Analysis is a branch of data analysis aiming at representing data
by means of topological information. Such representations are very different from
classical statistical ones and posses interesting properties that can be used to tackle
data analysis problems with a different perspective. We will represent functions by
means of objects called merge trees, and with their properties we will look at the
problem of alignment and smoothing of functional data within a benchmark case study.
