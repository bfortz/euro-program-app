For partitioning clustering methods, the number of clusters has to be determined
in advance and is therefore an important issue. Besides the application of so-called
internal validation indices, the determination of an optimal number of clusters can
be achieved with stability indices. In this paper several stability based validation
methods are investigated with regard to the k-prototypes algorithm for mixed-type
data, which is an extension to the popular k-means algorithm.
  Under consideration are the Jaccard coefficient, the Simple Matching coefficient
and the indices published by Fowlkes and Mallows as well as by von Luxburg.
Furthermore, the weighted average of cluster-wise stability values based on the
Jaccard index and a numerical approximation of the stability value interpretation
proposed by Ben-Hur et al. were investigated. The stability based approaches are
compared to common internal validation indices in a comprehensive simulation
study in order to analyze preferability as a function of the underlying data generating
process.
