A Proposal for Formalization and Definition of Anomalies in Dynamical Systems

"Jan Michael" Spoor, Jens Weber, and Jivka Ovtcharova

Although many scientists strongly focus on anomaly detection in different applications 
and domains, there currently exists no universally accepted definition of anomalies and 
outliers bib2. Using an approach based on control theory and dynamical systems, as well 
as a definition for anomalies as described by philosophy of science bib5, the authors 
propose a generalized framework viewing anomalies as key drivers of progress for a better 
understanding of the dynamical systems around us. By mathematically defining anomalies and 
delimiting deviations within expectations from completely unforeseen instances, this paper 
aims to be a contribution to set up a universally accepted definition of anomalies and outliers.

Keywords: anomaly detection, outlier analysis, dynamical systems
