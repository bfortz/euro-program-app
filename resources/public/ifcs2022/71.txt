Given multiple data blocks from different sources sharing the same observations
(such as psychological questionnaires or genetic risk scores), Simultaneous 
Component Analysis (SCA) aims to find a few linear combinations of the variables
that explain as much as possible the variability in the joined data set. However,
rooting the analysis on all variables makes interpretability difficult, especially in
high-dimensional settings. Therefore, looking for a sparse structure is natural; it
identifies the common and distinctive source of variation across all data blocks.
Solving the sparse SCA problem is intractable, given its combinatorial nature. Here,
the nonconvex SCA problem is formulated as different convex maximization problems over 
the sphere, inducing sparsity via cardinality constraint and lasso penalties.
To solve these models, optimization algorithms based on the alternating directions
methods are proposed; these algorithms find high-quality feasible solutions for large
dimensions. Extensive experiments, including a real-world data set, are used to assess
the solution quality, computational time, and scalability of the methods.
