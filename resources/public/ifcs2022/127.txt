Spherical Separation in Machine Learning

Matteo Avolio, Annabella Astorino, and Antonio Fuduli

We extend the spherical separation approach to clustering problems and to the
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm, the latter constituting a kind of weak
supervised classification, using a multisphere criterion. In both the cases, while the
centers of the spheres are heuristically fixed, the corresponding radii are computed
by solving a specific optimization problem.
  In particular, for the clustering problem, all the centers are fixed in advance as
the barycenters of the current clusters (as in the standard K-Means algorithm), while
the corresponding radii are computed by solving a finite numbers of transportation
problems.
  Instead, in the case of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem whose objective
is to categorize bags of instances, our proposed technique is based on iteratively 
separating the bags by means of successive maximum-margin spheres (whose number
is automatically determined), obtained by solving successive linear programs.
  Numerical results on some test problems drawn from the literature show the
effectiveness of our proposals.
