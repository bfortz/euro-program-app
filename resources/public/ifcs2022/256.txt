A Showcase of New Methods for High Dimensional Data Viewing with Linear
Projections and Sections

Dianne Cook

In the last few years there have been several huge strides in new methods available
for exploring high-dimensional data using tours. Tours is the collective term for
visualisations built on linear projections. Tours have two key elements: the path that
generates a sequence, and the display to make of the low-dimensional projection.
There are numerous path algorithms available (and implemented in the tourr [1]
R package), including the old (grand, guided, little, local, manual), and the new
(slice [2], sage [3]). This talk will show off these new tools and how they can be used
for several contemporary problems, including understanding nonlinear dimension
reductions (e.g. t-SNE) using the liminal [4] R package, and explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) using the cheem [5] R package. Step into the fascinating world of
high-dimensions with me.

This most recent methodology is joint with primarily Ursula Laa, German Valencia,
Stuart Lee and Nicholas Spyrison.
