Comparison of Similarity Measures for Categorical Data in Hierarchical Clustering

Zdenek Sulc and Hana Rezankova

This contribution examines 13 similarity measures for data characterized by nominal
variables in hierarchical clustering. Most of the measures come from [1], where
they were initially studied in outlier detection tasks, and two of them are newly
proposed in [2]. The inspected measures consider additional characteristics of the
clustered dataset, such as a frequency distribution of categories or the number of
categories of a given variable, which should lead to a better cluster quality than
the commonly used simple matching approach. The experiment is conducted on 60
generated datasets. It compares and evaluates the similarity measures regarding the
quality of the produced clusters in hierarchical clustering using the mean ranked
scores of two internal evaluation criteria. The calculations are performed using the
nomclust R package [3]. The obtained results determine which similarity measures
are the most suitable for use with a given number of variables or a linkage algorithm.
