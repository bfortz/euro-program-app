The impact of the internet, social media and smart devices means that people are
becoming increasingly literate with use of these technologies and it has changed
how we engage with others on a professional and personal level. For the analyst, the
capacity to adapt to such changes has impacted upon the tools designed for analyzing 
“big data”, i.e. huge amount of numerical and categorical data. One of the most 
important tools is that of “visualization”. 
  With focus on categorical data, this tutorial, after briefly introducing association 
indices, models and methods, will outline some cutting-edge visualization tools and 
techniques.
