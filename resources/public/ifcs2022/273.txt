Pitfalls of Automatic Optimization Procedures and Benchmarking in Cluster Analysis

Quirin Stier and Michael C. Thrun

The pitfalls and challenges of automatic approaches are outlined in the case that
relevant and possibly prior unknown relationships in high-dimensional biological
datasets are to be discovered [1]. Priorly, [2] proposed one or more unsupervised
quality measures for the automatic selection of clustering algorithms and their 
parameter optimization. However, employing optimization procedures within automated
pipelines is biased and not recommended if we assume there may be only one optimal 
partitioning of data, e.g., diagnoses or therapies [1]. Thus, the limitations of
a clustering algorithm induced by a global clustering criterion cannot be overcome
by optimizing the algorithm parameters which only reduces the variance but not the
intrinsic bias of the criterion [1]. Furthermore, such optimization can yield 
significant improvements even if the dataset does not possess any cluster structure. 
Finally, our work shows that benchmarking clustering algorithms using first-order 
statistics or box plots on a small number of trials leads to misleading comparisons 
between algorithms. Assuming patterns in the data which can be recognizd by experts, 
we use artifical generated datasets [3]. On these datasets, 41 open-source and state
of-the-art algorithms standardized within R and Python in the “FCPS” library [4]
are evaluated to disprove the claim of [2] that automatic algorithm and parameter
selection by unsupervised quality measures is a viable approach in cluster analysis.
