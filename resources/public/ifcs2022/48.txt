Improving Classification of Documents by Semi-Supervised Clustering 
in a Semantic Space

In the paper we propose method for representation of documents in a semantic 
lowerdimensional space based on the modified Reduced k-means method which penalize
clusterings that are distant from classification of train documents given by experts.
Iterative method of the Reduced k-means (RKM) [1] enables simultaneously clustering 
of documents and extraction of factors. By projection of documents represented in the 
vector space model on extracted factors, documents are clustered in the semantic space 
in a semi-supervised way because clustering is guided by classification given by experts, 
which enables improvement of classification performance of test documents.
  Classification performance is tested for classification by logistic regression and support 
vector machines (SVMs) for classes of Reuters-21578 data set. It is shown that representation 
of documents by the RKM method with penalization improves average precision of classification 
for 25 largest classes of Reuters collection for about 5,5% with the same level of average 
recall  in comparison to the basic representation in the vector space model. In the case on 
classification by logistic regression, representation by the RKM with penalization improves 
average recall for about 1% in comparison to the basic representation.
