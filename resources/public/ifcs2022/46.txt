Outlier Detection for BIG Functional Data

The need to find influential users in social networks motivates a multidisciplinary
line of research whose final result, from the point of view of Statistics, is the 
development and implementation of several procedures for detecting outliers in functional
data that are scalable for massive data and that are also competitive, in terms of performance, 
with the most used algorithms in the usual literature on functional data. Brushstrokes of 
theoretical contributions and various fields of practical application will be provided.

Keywords: functional data, outlier detection, scalable algorithms
