Envelope-Based Support Vector Machine Classifier

Alya Alzahrani and Andreas Artemiou

The envelope method is a relatively new and efficient dimension reduction technique
that was introduced in the regression framework by Cook 2010 [1]. In this work,
we extended this method to classification and developed a new projection-based 
approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Our proposed classifier
is obtained by combining the envelope method and SVM to achieve a better and more
efficient classification. Using the idea of the envelope to extract a lower-dimensional
subspace projected the data on has advanced the classification performance.

Keywords: classification, dimension reduction, support vector machine, 
          envelope methods.
