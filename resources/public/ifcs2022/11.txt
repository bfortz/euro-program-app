Similarity Forest for Time Series Classification

The idea of similarity forest comes from Sathe and Aggarwal [1] and is derived
from random forest. Random forests proved to be one of the most excellent methods,
showing top performance across a vast array of domains, preserving simplicity, time
efficiency, still being interpretable at the same time. However, its usage is limited 
to multidimensional data. Similarity forest does not require such representation — it 
is only needed to compute similarities between observations. Thus, it may be applied
to data, for which multidimensional representation is not available. In this paper,
we propose the implementation of similarity forest for time series classification. We
compare the performance of similarity forest with 1NN classifier and random forest
on the UCR benchmark database. We show that similarity forest with DTW, taking
into account mean ranks, outperforms other classifiers. The comparison is enriched
with statistical analysis.
