The present contribution aims at introducing a network data reduction method for
the analysis of 3-way networks [1] in which classes of nodes of different types are
linked. The proposed approach enables simplifying a 3-way network into a weighted
two-mode network by considering the statistical concept of joint dependence in a
multiway contingency table. Starting from a real application on student mobility data
in Italian universities [2], a 3-way network is defined, where provinces of residence,
universities and educational programmes are considered as the three sets of nodes,
and occurrences of student exchanges represent the set of links between them. The
Infomap community detection algorithm [3] is then chosen for partitioning two-mode
networks of students’ cohorts to discover different network patterns.
