A Review on Official Survey Item Classification for Mixed-Mode Effects Adjustment

Afshin Ashofteh and Pedro Campos

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct impact on the development, production,
and dissemination of official statistics. This situation led National Statistics Institutes
(NSIs) to make methodological and practical choices for survey collection without
the need for the direct contact of interviewing staff (i.e. remote survey data collection). 
Mixing telephone interviews (CATI) and computer-assisted web interviewing
(CAWI) with direct contact of interviewing constitute a new way for data collection
at the time COVID-19 crisis. This paper presents a literature review to summarize
the role of statistical classification and design weights to control coverage errors and
non-response bias in mixed-mode questionnaire design. We identified 289 research
articles with a computerized search over two databases, Scopus and Web of Science.
It was found that, although employing mixed-mode surveys could be considered as a
substitution of traditional face-to-face interviews (CAPI), proper statistical classification 
of survey items and responders is important to control the nonresponse rates and coverage error 
risk.

Keywords: mixed-mode official surveys, item classification, weighting methods, clustering,
