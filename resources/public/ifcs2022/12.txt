Physical activity trajectories from the Trial of Activity in Adolescent Girls (TAAG)
capture the various exercise habits over female adolescence. Previous analyses of
this longitudinal data from the University of Maryland field site, examined the effect
of various individual-, social-, and environmental-level factors impacting the change
in physical activity levels over 14 to 23 years of age. We aimed to understand the
differences in physical activity levels after controlling for these factors. Using a
Bayesian linear mixed model incorporating a model-based clustering procedure for
random deviations that does not specify the number of groups a priori, we find that
physical activity levels are starkly different for about 5% of the study sample. These
young girls are exercising on average 23 more minutes per day.
