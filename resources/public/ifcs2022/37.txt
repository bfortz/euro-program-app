Towards a Bi-Stochastic Matrix Approximation of K-Means and Some Variants

Lazhar Labiod and Mohamed Nadif

The k-means algorithm and some k-means variants have been shown to be useful and
effective to tackle the clustering problem. In this paper we embed k-means variants
in a bi-stochastic matrix approximation (BMA) framework. Then we derive from
the k-means objective function a new formulation of the criterion. In particular, we
show that some k-means variants are equivalent to algebraic problem of bi-stochastic
matrix approximation under some suitable constraints. For optimizing the derived
objective function, we develop two algorithms; the first one consists in learning a
bi-stochastic similarity matrix while the second seeks for the optimal partition which
is the equilibrium state of a Markov chain process. Numerical experiments on real
data-sets demonstrate the interest of our approach.
