Reconstruction of Atomic Measure Based on Its Simplicial Depth

Petra Laketa and Stanislav Nagy

Statistical depth functions have been introduced in order to generalize the notions of
ranks, orderings and quantiles in the multivariate case. Depth is a function that to
any point x assigns the quantity which aims to describe how centrally positioned is x
respect to a given measure. It is of importance to explore whether the depth function
contains all the information of the underlying measure, i.e. does it characterise it. By
characterising we mean that there is no other measure with the same depth function
everywhere. We focus on the special case of simplicial depth, introduced in [1, 2]
and the class of atomic measures. In this particular setup, under mild assumption
of atoms being in general position, we prove that the characterisation property is
satisfied and describe an algorithm for recovering atomic measure from its simplicial
depth.
