Old and New Constraints in Model Based Clustering

Model-based approaches to cluster analysis and mixture modeling often involve
maximizing classification and mixture likelihoods. Without appropriate constrains
on the scatter matrices of the components, these maximizations result in ill-posed
problems. Moreover, without constrains, non-interesting or “spurious” clusters are
often detected by the EM and CEM algorithms traditionally used for the maximization 
of the likelihood criteria. A useful approach to avoid spurious solutions is
to restrict relative components scatter by a prespecified tuning constant. Recently
new methodologies for constrained parsimonious model-based clustering have been
introduced which include the 14 parsimonious models that are often applied in
model-based clustering when assuming normal components as limit cases. In this
paper we initially review the traditional approaches and illustrate through an example
the benefits of the adoption of the new constraints.
