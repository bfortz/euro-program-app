Clustering

In the last twenty five years robust several proposals for maximum likelihood 
estimation based on trimming and constraints have been developed. For these 
procedures, consistency results have been obtained and their robustness has been 
justified.
  There remains an open issue, when applying estimators based on the joint application 
of trimming and constraints, related to choosing the number of clusters, the level
of trimming and the strength of the constraints imposed on the components’ scatter
matrices. Some exploratory tools are available to help users make these decisions
using so-called “ctlcurves”.
  A new parametric bootstrap-based likelihood ratio test procedure has been developed 
to identify combinations of input parameters associated to the most interesting
clustering solutions. The statistical properties of this proposal and empirical evidence
on its performance when applied to artificial and real data, including contaminating
observations, will be presented.
