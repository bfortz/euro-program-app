Two-Stage Principal Component Analysis on Interval-Valued Data Using Patterned
Covariance Structure

A new approach is developed for facial recognition using principal component
analysis of interval-valued data. We exploit patterned covariance structures in doing
so and we accomplish this in two stages: first, we get eigenblocks and eigenmatrices
of the patterned variance-covariance matrix, and then we analyze these eigenblocks
and the corresponding principal vectors together in some appropriate way to get the
principal components of the interval-valued data. We apply our method to the face
recognition data in [1]. We take care of the three sequences of each face by using
structured covariance matrices and answer the question whether three sequences
belong to the same face or not. Face sequence recognition or classification is an
important problem as face might slightly change due to several reasons. Results
illustrating the accuracy and appropriateness of the new method over the existing
methods are presented.
