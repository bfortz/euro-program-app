A Rule-Based Approach to Scoring Systems

Michael Rapp, Johannes Fürnkranz, and Eyke Hüllermeier

Scoring systems have a long history of active use in safety-critical domains such
as healthcare and justice, where they provide guidance for making objective and
accurate decisions. While scoring systems have often been handcrafted by domain
experts in the past, the use of machine learning algorithms to deduce decision models
from historic data is becoming more prevalent, also due to an increased availability
of data and computational resources. In this work, we present an overview of existing
methods for the data-driven construction of scoring systems and propose a taxonomy
for characterizing the different types of models they produce. We further provide a
new perspective on the topic by establishing a connection between scoring systems
and additive rule models, and propose a rule-based methodology that allows for
constructing scoring systems with different characteristics. In an experimental study,
we investigate the effects of various constraints that are typically imposed on the
complexity of scoring systems to facilitate their use by human practitioners. We also
investigate how existing rule learning techniques help reduce negative impacts in
terms of predictive accuracy they may entail.
