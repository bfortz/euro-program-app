Nonparametric Regressions for Distributional Data

Albert Meco, Javier Arroyo, and Antonio Irpino

In distributional data individuals are described by means of distributions. While 
distributions are complex data representations, several methods have been successfully
proposed to analyze data represented by distributional variables, giving rise to the
field distributional data analysis [1]. In particular, several authors have proposed
regression methods to model some specific kinds of linear relationships that can
take place among distributional variables. However, such methods may suffer in
cases where the linear relationship in the data is not the one the method can deal
with, or when the relationship in the data is not linear. In such cases, nonparametric
regression methods would be able to effectively model the underlying relationship.
  We propose three nonparametric regression methods for distributional data: the
kernel regression and the locally weighted regression using the Dias-Brito [2] and
the Irpino-Verde [3] linear regressions for distributional data. The performance of the
proposed methods and the linear approaches will be compared by means of a Monte
Carlo experiment that will consider different underlying relationships in the data. In
addition, we propose the use of several statistical measures and plots to analyze the
regression fit and its errors to better understand how the regressions work.
