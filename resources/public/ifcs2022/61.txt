A Moment-Free Measure of Multivariate Skewness

Andrzej Sokolowski and Malgorzata Markowska

Multivariate skewness measures proposed in the literature are usually generalizations
of univariate ones, and are based on the third central moment or Pearson’s relation
between mode, mean and standard deviation. Popular measure was proposed by
Mardia [2], and good review of other propositions can be found in [1]. The aim of
the paper is to propose a new measure of sample multivariate skewness which uses
the idea of a ”mirror observation”. The measure is calculated on standardized data.
The ”mirror observation” is an artificial point lying on the line from the given data
point through the coordinate origin, within the same distance to the origin as the
actual point, and located on the other side of the origin. Then the distance from the
real data point closest to the mirror one is used in the construction of the measure,
which is finally the average over all data points. The problem of assymetry sign
is discussed as well as the distribution of the measure under multivariate normal
distribution. The empirical example compares the multivariate skewness of different
socio-economic spheres in European Union countries distribution.
