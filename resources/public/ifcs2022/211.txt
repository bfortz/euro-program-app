Bayesian Classification and Non-Bayesian Label Estimation via EM Algorithm to Identify
Differential Expression in Omics Data: a Comparative Study

Marilia Antunes and Lisete Sousa

Analyses of omics data (biomolecules including large macromolecules such as proteins 
and nucleic acids, as well as small molecules such as metabolites and natural
products) allow comprehensive genome-wide analysis of complex diseases, offering
a major advantage over previous candidate gene analysis or pathway analysis. One of
the main goals in high-throughput data analysis is the identification of biomolecules
among several thousands that differ between different sample groups.
  Omics data classification problem is studied considering the ratio of the expression
levels and a non-observed categorical variable indicating how differentially expressed
each biomolecule is: non differentially expressed, down-regulated or up-regulated.
Assuming that the ratios follow a mixture of gamma distributions, two methods are
proposed [1]. The first method is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The conditional 
probability of a biomolecule to belong to each group is calculated and the
biomolecule is assigned to the group for which this conditional probability is higher.
The second method uses the EM algorithm to estimate the most likely group label
for each biomolecule, that is, to assign the biomolecule to the group which contains
it with the higher estimated probability. Both approaches are applied to omics data
and results are compared.
