with Machine Learning Algorithms

Clustering is considered as one of the most used techniques in Data Science. 
Clustering functional data is a challenging problem since it involves working in 
an infinite dimensional space. In this work this problem is addressed by applying 
the epigraph and the hypograph indexes to a functional dataset and thereby, converting 
it from a functional data problem into a multivariate problem. See [1]. Once the 
multivariate dataset is obtained, the techniques that have been fully studied in the 
literature for clustering multivariate data can be applied, including both procedures 
typical of the area of Statistics and those from the machine learning field. This 
methodology is applied to both simulated and real datasets, and it is also compared to 
two clustering techniques originally designed for functional data ([2] and [3]).
