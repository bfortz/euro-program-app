via Nonparametric Gaussian Scale Mixtures

An accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a popular regression model in survival
analysis. It models the relationship between the failure time and a set of covariates via
a log link with an addition of a random error. The model can be either parametric or
semiparametric depending on the degree of specification of the error distribution. The
covariates are usually assumed to be fixed - ‘time independent’. In many biomedical
studies, however, ‘time-dependent’ covariates are frequently observed and Cox and
Oakes [1] proposed an AFT model with time-dependent covariates.
In this work, we consider a semiparametric time-dependent AFT model. We assume
that the distribution of the baseline failure time as an infinite scale mixture of
Gaussian densities. Thus, this model is highly flexible compared to that assumes a
one-component parametric density. We consider a maximum likelihood estimation
and propose an algorithm based on the constrain newton method [2] for estimating
model parameters and mixing distributions. The proposed methods are investigated
via simulation studies to assess the finite sample properties. The proposed methods
are illustrated with a real data set.
