Road traffic accidents are one of the major social problems in modern societies. Data
science plays an important role in its explanation and prediction. One of the main
objectives of accident data analysis is to identify the main factors associated with a
road traffic accident. The present study aims to contribute to the identification of the
determinants for the nature (collision, car crash or pedestrian runing over) of road
accidents. Four-year road accident data from 2016 to 2019 in a district of Portugal
is analyzed. Three logit models, a multinomial logit regression model and several
machine learning algorithms are used, and their performance is compared. Findings
show that some determinants which can explain the nature of the accident are:
geographical factors (municipality, in/outside localities and parking areas), temporal
factors (air temperature and wheater), time of the day (hour, day of the week and
month), drivers’ characteristics (gender and age), vehicles’ features (type and age)
and road characteristics (straight/curved track and road type).
