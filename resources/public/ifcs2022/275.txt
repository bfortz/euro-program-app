The Use of Regression to Partition a Dataset of Interval Observations

Lynne Billard and Fei Liu

The use of regression modelling has an extensive history; likewise, clustering
methodologies have existed for some time. In this work, we extend the dynamical 
partitioning concepts developed initially by Diday and Simon [1] combined with
the k-means clustering approach of MacQueen [3], to a k-regression algorithm to
enable clustering of interval-valued observations based on regression models. The
usefulness of the algorithm is verified through some simulated data (as in the plots
below) and applied to real data sets. More details can be found in [2].

Keywords: k-means, k-regression algorithm, dynamical partitioning
