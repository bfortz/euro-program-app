The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on different aspects of economy.
Usually the impact on traditonal economy. The paper presents the results of the
analysis of the changes in the Polish traditional drugstores market during COVID-19
situation (from 2019 till 2021). Three different approaches with dynamic multidimensional 
scaling have been evaluated: classical data, symbolic interval-valued variables and symbolic 
histogram variables. The results show that symbolic historgram variables are able to capture 
all the variability in the data and refect all the changes.

Keywords: histogram variables, mutidimensional scaling, drugstores, covid-19
