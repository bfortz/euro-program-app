Clustering Rainfall by Simulated Annealing for Histogram Symbolic Data

Alejandro Chacon and Javier Trejos

We present the use of simulated annealing for clustering histogram symbolic data
[2], by the minimization of a criterion based on a Huygens-type decomposition of
inertia defined by Wasserstein distance. An efficient cooling scheme for simulated
annealing was implemented [1], with variable length Markov chains, allowing a
large exploration in the search space. A simplification of inertia change was found
in order to efficiently use Metropolis rule. The algorithm was tested on maximum
daily rainfall data sets for last 40 years in Costa Rica, in 14 meteorological stations
in the Reventazon river basin. Results were compared to a k-means algorithm [3], ´
with a general improvement in quality.
