How to Mitigate the Effect of Outliers on Balancing Technique

Imbalanced data brings additional difficulties to the analysis of the data since the
distribution of the number of observations across the known classes is skewed. The
skewness implies that the number of observations in the Minority class is drastically
smaller than the number of observations in the Majority class. This is a problem
since, typically, the Minority class is the interesting and relevant class. Many real
world applications face this issue due to their natural characteristics, such as fraud
detection, rare disease detection, etc.
  Balancing techniques are a common strategy to overcome imbalanced data problems,
but the presence of outliers may lead to bias and poor results, especially when the
outliers are located in the Minority class and we use classical methods.
  In this work, first, we illustrate the negative effect of outliers on the performance
of classical balancing techniques. Next, we propose a robust balancing technique
to mitigate the effect of outliers - named RM-SMOTE â€“ which combines the idea
of SMOTE with robust Mahalanobis distance. We propose to automatically down
weight atypical Minority class observations so that they have a low chance of being
selected in the resampling step.
  The performance of the RM-SMOTE is evaluated using simulated data with different
levels of contamination, and benchmark imbalanced datasets. The results indicate
the superiority of RM-SMOTE when handling different proportions of outliers. In
cases where the observations are not linearly separable, RM-SMOTE superiority is
even more evident.
