Shrinkage Methods

With the advance of modern technology, and with data being recorded continuously,
functional data analysis has gained a lot of popularity in recent years. Working
in a mixture model-based framework, we develop a flexible functional clustering
technique achieving dimensionality reduction schemes through a L_1 penalization.
The proposed procedure results in an integrated modelling approach where shrinkage
techniques are applied to enable sparse solutions in both the means and the covariance
matrices of the mixture components, while preserving the underlying clustering
structure. This leads to an entirely data-driven methodology suitable for simultaneous
dimensionality reduction and clustering. Preliminary experimental results, both from
simulation and real data, show that the proposed methodology is worth considering
within the framework of functional clustering.
