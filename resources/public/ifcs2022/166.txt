a Comparison

Two iterative techniques, called T3Clus and 3Fkmeans, aimed at a simultaneous
clustering of objects and a factorial dimensionality reduction of variables and 
occasions on three-mode data sets, as well as a combination of these two procedures
were proposed in [1]. In each iteration, T3Clus (3Fkmeans) is based on a sequential
application of the Tucker2 algorithm and the k-means algorithm (vice versa). We
have implemented the three simultaneous methods in Python. In this work, applications 
on real data sets are presented to show the features of these three simultaneous
methods when compared with tandem analyses which can be executed in two different ways. 
In a tandem analysis only one sequential application of clustering and factorial 
methodologies is performed.
