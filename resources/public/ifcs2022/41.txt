New Metrics for Classifying Phylogenetic Trees Using k-Means and the Symmetric 
Difference Metric

Nadia Tahiri and Aleksandr Koshkarov

The k-means method can be adapted to any type of metric space and is sometimes
linked to the median procedures. This is the case for symmetric difference metric 
(or Robinson and Foulds [1]) distance in phylogeny, where it can lead to median trees
as well as to Euclidean Embedding. We show how a specific version of the popular
k-means clustering algorithm, based on interesting properties of the Robinson and
Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one
(when the data is homogeneous) or several (when the data is heterogeneous) cluster(s)
of trees. We have adapted the popular cluster validity indices of Silhouette, and Gap
to tree clustering with k-means based on a previous work by Tahiri et al. [2]. In this
article, we will show results of this new approach on a real dataset (aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases) of Woese et al. [3]. The new version of phylogenetic tree clustering
makes the new method well suited for the analysis of large genomic datasets.
