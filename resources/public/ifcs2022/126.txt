Quantile-Distribution Functions and Their Use for Classification

We develop a flexible parametric framework for the estimation of quantile functions.
The method involves the specification of an analytical quantile distribution function
for the data at hand [1]. We focus on quantile functions that are linear with respect
to their parameters, such as the flattened generalized logistic distribution [2]: these
can adapt to a wide range of distributional shapes and allow for the estimation to be
carried out through a computationally efficient least-squares method based on the
order statistics.
  Inferential properties of this estimator, such as its asymptotic distribution, are 
derived, and these allow for the definition of a test of hypothesis for the equality of 
two distributions. The properties of the test are evaluated via a simulation study.
  Our method of quantile function estimation is implemented as a density estimation
method in the naive Bayes classifier. This innovation is compared to standard approaches 
for the classifier in a simulation study, and is illustrated on a real data set coming 
from microRNA profiling in human Medulloblastoma. Moreover, the test of hypothesis is 
shown to be useful as a variable selection method.
