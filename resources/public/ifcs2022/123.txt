Four Skewed Tensor Variate Distributions

In recent years, data has become more and more complex, coming in many different
forms. One such example is data that come in the form of higher order tensors.
Some examples of these type of data are coloured images, video clips, and medical
data. Just like in the multivariate and matrix variate cases, the tensor or multilinear
normal distribution is most commonly used in the literature; however, in the area
of clustering and classification, if the data is skewed or contain outliers, then the
use of a tensor normal distribution may result in over fitting the number of groups.
We will introduce four skewed tensor variate distributions which will be utilized for
model-based clustering and classification. Parameter estimation and properties will
be discussed, and simulated and real data will be used for illustration.
