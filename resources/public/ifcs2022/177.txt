A New Functional Data Clustering Technique Based on Spectral Clustering and Downsampling

We present a new framework for clustering functional data along with a new paradigm
for performing model selection based on downsampling. Our clustering framework is
a generalisatiion of the spectral clustering approach and is flexible enough to exploit
higher order features of curves, including derivatives. Extensive comparative studies
with existing methods show a clear advantage of our approach over existing functional
data analysis clustering approaches. Additionally, we present a new paradigm for
model selection, by introducing the technique of downsampling, which allows us
to create lower resolution replicates of the observed curves. These replicates can
then be used to provide insight into the tuning parameters for the specific clustering
techniques. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through simulations
and applications to real-life datasets.
