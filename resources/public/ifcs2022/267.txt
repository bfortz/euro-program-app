COVID-19 has been spreading in Japan and other parts of the world since 2020.
In Japan, the number of newly confirmed positive cases is reported daily in the
news. As the number of infected people increases, restraints on behavior and other
measures have been taken to control the spread of infection. Our group has developed
a system to visualize the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in five prefectures
where university campuses are located, so that the status of the spread of COVID19 
infection can be monitored. ([1],[2], http://covid-map.bmi-tokai.jp/) The system
provides a visualization of the number of newly confirmed positive cases in each
municipality, and is designed to provide an interactive function to provide the user
with the information he or she wants to know. We present the details of the data
collection method as well as the visualization information realized by this system.
