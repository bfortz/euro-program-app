Hierarchies and Weak-Hierarchies as Interval Convexities

P. Bertrand and J. Diatta

There are several ways to characterize a hierarchy, one being a collection of nonempty
subsets that are convex according to a type of interval function. This characterization
in terms of interval convexity, extends to general classes of multilevel clusterings,
thus providing a unifying theoretical framework [1, 2]. We expand this line of research, 
with a special attention to specifications allowing the capture of clusterings
usually constructed in data mining practice, such as the Apresjan and the single-link
hierarchies. We propose: (a) New characterizations of hierarchies and weak hierarchies 
as interval convexities, (b) Interval functions which induce known clustering schemes 
such as the Single Link hierarchy or the Apresjan hierarchy, (c) A sequence of nested 
families of interval convexities that is gradually increasing from the Apresjan hierarchy 
to the Single-Link hierarchy, which enables the detection of redundant clusters.
