Symbolic t-SNE and UMAP Methods for Interval Type Variables.

Oldemar Rodríguez Rojas

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a very new method
for dimension reduction. UMAP method improve t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding) method for data visualization and dimensionality reduction.
The great advantage of UMAP is that it preserves better than t-SNE the global
structure with superior run time performance. The foregoing makes UMAP an ideal
method to be applied to the hyper-rectangles that are in the rows of the symbolic data
table with interval-type variables, since UMAP compresses the structure inside each
hyper-rectangle very well and at the same time better preserves the global structure
of the clusters generated by each hyper-rectangle. This paper presents an adapted
version of the t-SNE and UMAP methods for interval type variables. In addition, R
and Python codes for both generalizations are presented.

Keywords: symbolic data analysis, t-SNE, umap, interval variables.
