Self-report survey instruments are frequently used to investigate differences between
groups of respondents, such as citizens of different nations in cross-country comparative 
analyses. In this context, a main methodological problem pertain to the configural invariance 
of the measurement instrument, which holds if the latent structure has the same pattern across 
different groups across the groups. In this work, to address this issue, we adopt an exploratory 
approach rooted in the framework of graph theory. Specifically, considering a multi-group comparative 
analysis and measurement instruments consisting of ordered categorical indicators, we discuss the
use of exploratory graph analysis to assess the instrument configural invariance. In
this framework, networks are used to represent latent constructs, and the covariance
between observable indicators is explained in terms of a pattern of causal interactions
between the items. Hence, we assume that if the measurement instrument functions
invariantly across the groups, the group specific correlation-based networks will be
characterised by a similar structure. The network structures are estimated through a
Bayesian approach with sparse inducing priors and network embedding will be used
to investigate the structure similarity. Through a simulation study we demonstrate
that the proposed method is able to identify the differences. Finally, the proposed
approach is applied to test the configural invariance of the Democracy Scale adopted
in the European Social Survey.
