In the social sciences, structural equation modeling has become an established
method for analyzing complex interrelationships between manifest and latent 
variables. In this context, the composite-based Partial Least Squares Path Modeling
(PLS-PM) approach [2] has gained popularity over the past decades because of its
versatility. Several segmentation methods dedicated to PLS-PM have been proposed
to account for the potential heterogeneity of the data [3]. These techniques differ
from each other in various aspects such as proceeding in two steps (PLS-PM then 
segmentation) or not (simultaneous determination of local PLS-PM models per group),
being based on finite mixture models, on a distance or more recently on alternate
least squares algorithm [1], etc. In this presentation, we propose to compare these
segmentation approaches both theoretically according to the criterion they optimize
and practically by evaluating the stability of the different segmentations obtained 
on the basis of a case study pertaining to marketing.
