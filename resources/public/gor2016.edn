production/distillation of scotch single malt whisky has reached sufficiently high levels of technical efficiency within the last years, especially concerning the most cost-intensive factors such as, e.g., labor. Because of the low/zero prices of the remaining factors as e.g. barley, water and air, (partial) inefficiencies concerning their input will hardly decrease distilleries’ profits as well. Thus enhancing quality of single malt whisky nowaydays seems more important. In the paper a quality adjusted, two-model DEA approach, invented by Sherman and Zhu (2006) and modified by Shimshak and Lenard (2007), is applied on empirical data of scotch whisky to identify quality leaders. Quality is incorporated in the model by considering distilleries as quality producing DMUs whose outputs are qualitatively captured via the rating scheme of MURRAYS Whisky Bible. Its categories Nose, Taste, Finish and Balance, each of them ranging from 0-25 Points, serve as output criteria so the distillation technology can be checked for quality-benchmarks. An input-oriented envelop model with constant returns to scale (CCR) is run using the software MaxDEABasic64. The results, inter alia, show that exceeding the legal minimum of storage time of 3 years considerably decreases quality efficiency of whisky production, that is, the contribution of time to whisky quality has been systematically overestimated within theory and practice. Hence, an appropriate reduction of storage time seems advisable; this insight, by the way, seems to be a persuasive explanation for the use of so called non-age-statements, which are increasingly used by many distilleries as a replacement for explicit age declarations which are traditionally printed on whisky bottles (e. g. \"12 years old\").", :title "The older, the better..!? - Benchmarking Quality Efficiency of time-consuming Whisky Production using DEA", :keyword2 19, :authors (50136), :session 1211908}, 12 {:keyword1 177, :keyword3 165, :abstract "We analyze an innovative business model in which an operator of a renewable energy system provides an e-mobility service to customers.

Second, is the companies’ long-term stock performance after the IPO better when private equity investors’ involvement is higher at the IPO?

We model emissions based on the Comprehensive Emissions Model (CEM), which derives emissions from speed, load, and engine type.

The CEM is embedded within a tabu-search heuristic that was originally developed for the time-dependent vehicle routing problem. The procedure is adapted to include the computation of time-dependent, expected emissions- and cost-minimized paths between each pair of customers on the route. For computational experiments, we use instances derived from a real road network dataset and 230 million speed observations. We compare the emissions- and cost-optimal routes with solutions arising from more traditional objectives, e.g. minimizing distances and travel times, to understand how the planned routes differ. We then analyze how routes change with different fleet compositions, where emissions and cost objectives can lead to quite different results than traditional objectives.", :title "Comparing the minimization of travel times, emissions and costs in urban routing", :keyword2 175, :authors (16919 27111 7172), :session 87}, 37 {:keyword1 175, :keyword3 95, :abstract "Within intermodal container transportation chains, the trucking sections cause between 25% - 40% of all costs incurred.

Inbound containers can either be reused for outbound transportation requests (street-turns) or empty containers can be stored at and obtained from a common place, the depot. Each truck is able to transport up to two 20-foot containers or one 40-foot container.

We design a laboratory experiment in which buyers and sellers trade a fictitious good in double auction markets.

We find that the market equilibrium price in the treatment group is lower than in the control group. This difference is economically and statistically significant, and implies that sellers with access to evasion shift a smaller share of the statutory tax burden onto buyers relative to sellers without tax evasion opportunities. Interestingly, we find that sellers with evasion opportunities shift the full amount of their effective tax rate onto buyers. Additional experimental treatments show that the full shifting of the effective tax burden is due to the evasion opportunity itself rather than the evasion-induced lower effective tax rate.", :title "Tax Incidence in the Presence of Tax Evasion", :keyword2 0, :authors (51838 51839), :session 43}, 42 {:keyword1 149, :keyword3 166, :abstract "The identification and quantification of customer needs is an important process in order to design new products and services. As shown in previous work, it is possible to classify micro blog data (e.g. tweets) on their feature of containing a customer need or not by applying Machine Learning models. With such a model as a basis, we show that customer needs can be clustered and quantified in the relevant data for a domain of interest–in this case e-mobility–as long as the possibly occurring categories of needs are known in advance. To apply the proposed method to e-mobility, major needs in this field are identified from recent literature, resulting in four major categories: Cost-related, car-related, charging-related and social-related needs. Four disjunctive white lists containing keywords, generated from the previous literature review, serve as a foundation for the need quantification.  A first study shows that a white-list-based automatic clustering–relying on occurrences of the keywords–already achieves a high precision in the categories cost (82.8%) and charging (95%). The recall is unsteady between poor 13.1% (car-related needs) and solid 70.5% (charging-related needs).

Units are produced one at time in a make-to-stock fashion in anticipation of future demands with stochastic production times. If an order is fulfilled, the manufacturer instantly collects the sales revenue. However, if an order cannot be fulfilled immediately, the manufacturer incurs a backorder cost penalty if the order is from the long-term market otherwise the sale is lost if it is from the walk-in market. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal policy, in addition to specifying the optimal walk-in market sale price, is characterized by two state-dependent thresholds, one specifies how to allocate inventory among the two markets and the other specifies how to schedule production. We also treat the special cases of static and state of the world dependent walk-in market pricing as well as the case of a spot market where the price is exogenously set.

Smartness features can include, for instance, context-based adaptation, cognition, inference and rules that implement autonomous decision logic in order to realize services that automatically perform tasks on behalf of the users. This intelligence is implemented directly as part of the interface, instead of relying on the client or on the server to provide it.

While this trend lays the foundation for the development of a multitude of new Smart Services, it also introduces additional complexity - individual components have to be composed to form distributed applications. This situation is aggravated by the fact that currently, while developing distributed solutions, only interfaces and interactions, covering common use cases, are supported, while requirements of specific use cases (e.g., for enabling particular Smart Service) are difficult to realize.

We relax the assumption of many related works that the service provider has discretion about the assignment of customers to facilities; rather, we allow customers to self-select based on their preference for facility attributes according to an attraction-based choice model. Furthermore, we do not only capture the effect that congestion has on demand but also the reciprocal impact of demand on congestion and service level, respectively, by modeling each facility as an M/G/1 queue where service capacity is a decision variable.

The method consists of three phases to calculate the interarrival times of a node: merging, flow, splitting. Some well-known approximation formula for ordinary single class open queueing networks calculate the characteristics in each phase for each node as shown by Kuehn, Chylla, Whitt and Pujolle/Ai. Node performance measures such as mean queue length are determined by using approximation formula for non-Markovian queues. 2011 the decomposition method was extended to open queueing networks with batch processing using the approximation formula discribed by Pujolle/Ai. A comparison with discrete event simulation as benchmark shows that the approach provides good results. Thus, the approach was expanded for the approximation given by Kuehn, Chylla and Whitt. Since the method consists of several phases it is possible to combine different formula. For example merging will be approximated by Kuehn and flow by Whitt. To perform an evaluation the benchmark was done in regard to the 2011 publication. Approximation formula with the same approach generate similar results.

In order to achieve the objective of revenue maximization the airlines' control mechanism uses the cost-factors as input values to a control-scheme that defines the available price. This is done to guarantee that incoming bookings give a positive contribution to the objective. As sold seats cannot be offered again opportunity costs arise by the risk of spoilage if high yield customers are rejected due to overselling at discounted rates. Simultaneously the passengers' willingness-to-pay is estimated to control for price-elasticity-costs. These may occur if a seat is sold at a rate which is below the individuals willingness-to-pay. This paper will focus on the latter and discuss how statistical modeling is used to exploit the demand-price-relationship to control for price-elasticity-costs. In particular we will present how the shape constrained additive model framework is capable of discovering complex dependencies that impact price-elasticity. Subsequently it is shown how these estimates are utilized by a dynamic-pricing-scheme that sets the optimal-price equal to the marginal-revenue plus an additional cost factor. It is demonstrated by application of the proposed method to several real-data examples how this setup greatly simplifies the airlines' pricing.

As a result, a significant risk of robbery arises. A potential approach to decrease this risk is to generate k spatially dissimilar vehicle routing alternatives. By periodically changing the routes to dissimilar ones, the unpredictability of the actually driven routes can be increased which in turn can reduce the risk of robbery. An alternative to the k-dissimilar vehicle routing problem is therefore a set of k distinct routing alternatives. We assume that it will only be accepted by the decision maker if the difference between the distance of the longest routing alternative in the set and the distance of the best known routing alternative in the considered instance is within reasonable limits. Since the k shortest routing alternatives are often similar to each other, the k-dissimilar vehicle routing problem is inherently a bi-objective problem. We examine the tradeoff between the minimization of the distance of the longest routing alternative in the set and the maximization of the minimum dissimilarity between two routing alternatives in the set for k > 1. We further simplify the computation of an intuitive spatial dissimilarity metric taken from literature to measure the dissimilarity between two routing alternatives. An approach to approximate the Pareto set of all Pareto optimal sets of k routing alternatives with respect to the two introduced criteria is presented.

One of the oldest theories in finance, uncovered interest parity, provides an attractive explanation for the behavior of exchange rates.  Exchange rates should adjust to equalize returns on loans across countries.  This means that high interest-rate currencies will depreciate relative to low interest-rate currencies.  Unfortunately, empirical research has not been kind to this hypothesis.  Not only do exchange rates not adjust in the direction predicted by the theory, but in some samples they move in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nLong-run UIP, like any long-run financial hypothesis, is difficult to test.  To get sufficient statistical power to resolve the question would require many non-overlapping intervals, and financial time series are generally not long enough to provide a clear test for longer maturities.  Estimates for the effect of interest rates on exchange rates have proven to be rather unstable. Evidence suggests that interest rates themselves has a unit root, which makes statistical inference difficult.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we introduce a short-run test of long-run UIP.  This test sidesteps the econometric difficulties mentioned above, and provides unambiguous evidence in favor of long-run UIP.  UIP can be reinterpreted as a contemporaneous relationship between returns.  This relationship can be tested at a monthly frequency, which sidesteps the non-overlapping intervals problem.  Returns do not suffer from a unit root, and the estimates have the same sign as predicted by UIP in most subperiods.

Coordinate descent is a commonly studied version of gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on asynchronous coordinate descent on convex functions F:R^n→R of the form F(p) = f(p) + sum_{k=1}^n Psi_k(p_k), where f:R^n→R is a smooth convex function, and each Psi_k:R→R is a univariate and possibly non-smooth convex function.

Major customers of liner shipping companies are freight forwarders, who are responsible for the organization of the shipments by arranging the routing of cargo bookings using one or more carriers. Hence, a freight forwarder may direct flows along several paths by indirect routing via transshipments at hubs. In addition to providing cheap transportation solutions, freight forwarders should offer high service levels to their clients by providing on time delivery of cargo bookings for gaining a competitive edge.\r\nOur study focuses on the allocation of cargo bookings to predetermined routes where each route consists of various services and each service is operated by vessels of different liner shipping companies. The objective is to minimize cost of the freight forwarder, which has its own fleet and also acts one of the liner shipping companies operating on the complete network. The considered problem concentrates on achieving the on-time deliveries of cargo bookings through synchronization of transshipment operations at an operational level, as well as by minimizing the deviations of the freight forwarder’s vessels from their planned schedules.

Local trips depart and arrive to a hub and can visit collection and delivery points in the same tour.

For example, no-buffer flow-shop scheduling problem are well investigated. Here a real world flow shop with a transportation restriction is regarded. It has to produce small batches, very often with a lot size of one, with short response times. Thus, scheduling algorithms are needed to ensure that under the constraint of a high average load of the flow shop, the due dates of the production orders are met. This transportation restriction reduces the set of feasible schedules even more than the no-buffer restrictions discussed in the literature in the case of limited storage. Still this problem is NP-hard. Due to the transportation restriction, the duration of a job A on the flow-shop depends on the other jobs processed on the flow-shop in the same timeframe which is called a cycle. Realistic processing times are achieved by a simulation of the scheduling of A which includes the next jobs until A has left the flow-shop. The usage of such realistic processing times instead of net processing times improves the priority rules by around 16%. There are pools of jobs where a large variance of the cycle times is beneficial and pools of jobs where a small variance is better. This is partially detected by  a genetic algorithm.

The workload of the yard varies significantly throughout the day with peaks during the serving time of a vessel or during rush hour times in truck arrivals. In modern block storage systems only the top container of a stack can be retrieved. Therefore if a container needs to be retrieved but is blocked by other containers standing on top of it (called a mis-overlay), these other containers need to be reshuffled first. In order to reduce the retrieval time per container during times with high workload, the containers of a block are rearranged in times with low workload such that the number of expected mis-overlays during peak times is reduced. In this premarshalling phase, a reshuffle schedule with a minimal number of reshuffle moves within a bay is sought such that the rearranged containers do not contain any mis-overlays. In this problem's common formulation the containers are numbered according to their retrieval times and have to be sorted accordingly. But in practice the exact pick-up times for containers are not known previously. Especially for the pick-up times for containers that leave via truck only time intervals are known.

Referring to queueing approaches it is known that each type of variability, and especially its increase, reduces the performance of manufacturing systems and has to be buffered by an efficient mix of time, inventory and/or capacity (Hopp/Spearman, 2008, Factory Physics). Variability can be divided into operations variability (variability in processing times) and flow variability which defines the way jobs arrive and leave a production system (arrival and departure variability) (Hopp/Spearman, 2008, Factory Physics). In static-deterministic scheduling, variability is often discussed as part of an objective function, e.g. minimization of completion time variance (CTV) or minimization of variability of completion time differences (CTDVB2). While the CTV problem tends to finish all jobs at the same time (which is impossible), CTDVB2 is aimed at smoothing the distance in completion times of two consecutively scheduled jobs. This can be interpreted as departure variability of jobs in queueing approaches and as a first link between queueing theory and scheduling (Leisten, Rajendran, 2015, Variability of completion time differences in permutation flow shop scheduling).

Important phases in the planning of a public transportation system are, among others, line planning, timetabling and delay management.\r\nThe delay resistance of such a system is usually measured at the delay management stage. The measures which are to decrease the effect of delays are usually taken at the stages of timetabling (adding buffer, rearranging slack times) and delay management (developing methods which prevent the spreading of delays). One major reason for the propagation of delays, which is not controlled by those measures, are the passenger transfers. They can even be handled at the line planning stage.\r\nIn the literature there exists only few work studying the implication of the line planning stage towards delay resistance. Hence, the aim in this work is to provide a line planning model which forms the basis of highly delay resistant public transportation systems.

With a change of bias the outcome of correction methods become uncertain.

Another interesting observation is related to the realization of the metaheuristic algorithms; although the natural phenomenon where the analogy is made is usually dynamic and varying these algorithm’s internal structures are actually static. In this research we try to implement a metaheuristic algorithm which is known as Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS) as a truly dynamic optimization algorithm by making use of the multi-agent modelling and programming approach. In the proposed SDS algorithm solution vectors (agents) can communicate with each other for search direction determination, they can decide to disappear; new agents can appear (so the population size is not fixed) etc. In other words, the proposed algorithm has an inherent dynamic structure so it can be more easily adapted to dynamic optimization problems.

For that reason producing best quality particularly efficient is more important than ever for steel producers in high-cost countries like Germany. In our contribution we provide a short insight into our long-term cooperation with DILLINGER, one of the biggest heavy plate producers in the world. We set a special focus on the well-known Blocks-Relocation-Problem and its application in the steel industry. The basic problem deals with the removal of blocks out of storage in a given sequence. In the storage the blocks are stored in stacks. The objective is to minimize the amount of restacking. This problem also occurs for example at sea container terminals. Additionally we show how we expand the basic formulation to a Balanced-Blocks-Relocation-Problem. In our case the model is applied to a heavy plate store of the Heavy Fabrication Division at DILLINGER. Here several plates are buffered in stacks before they are processed at the customer’s request. The primary objective is to maximize (balance) the utilization of the downstream production with as little restacking operations as possible. For this purpose, we developed an efficient solution method for the Balanced-Blocks-Relocation-Problem, which is currently evaluated in the operations at DILLINGER. The system’s task is on the one hand to support the crane operators, who execute the restacking operations. On the other hand, it provides the opportunity to simulate future situations at the heavy plate store for several weeks to gain planning insights.

The emerging need for highly flexible, but cost-efficient power plant operations can be supported by (pumped) storages and their ability to flatten the residual demand for remaining plant activities. Scheduling and coordinating power plants and storages lead to the NP-hard Unit Commitment Problem with hydro-thermal coordination (UCP-HT). In order to substantially reduce the computational burden of the underlying MILP, we present a two-stage heuristic procedure. At the first stage, plant activities are preselected to fulfill the ever-changing residual demand as well as spinning reserve requirements without any storage activities. Moreover, typical techno-economic parameters like power output specifications, minimum up-/ down-times, and time-dependent startups are included. Hereby, start solutions obtained by a multi-start greedy algorithm are repaired and enhanced by rule-based algorithms and local optimization routines. The second stage improves the solutions in consideration of energy storages. The best storage allocation is found by local adjustments of previous solutions replacing committed plant activities stepwise by storage operations to achieve further cost reductions. The final solution consists of a near-optimal hourly dispatch of each thermal and storage unit for, e.g., a yearly time horizon.

E. Lucas and M. Staley, economic growth emerges as the collective result of the productivity of a large collection (swarm) of individual agents. We assume that the individual productivity of each agent can be represented on an abstract line, where movement in the positive direction represents an enhancement in productivity. The evolution in each individual agent’s productivity is idealized as a Brownian motion with a positive drift. This drift is composed of two parts. On the one hand, an individual component which takes the form of a positive constant and on the other hand, a time-dependent component resulting from the interaction with other agents. The latter component is interpreted here as an imitation mechanism, where the higher productivity state of leaders is to be a source of inspiration for laggards. The noise affecting the dynamics models the ubiquitous environmental uncertainties that affect the evolution of productivity over time. For a given agent, the imitation-based drift component depends in real-time on the number of productivity leaders detected within a range of observation and by their relative distance to the swarm’s barycenter. For very large swarms, we are able to show that, depending on the strength of the imitation process, a bifurcation exists between two drastically different productivity propagation regimes. Weak imitation between the agents leads to a diffusive and evanescent productivity wave, which contrasts with strong imitation regimes, which can sustain strongly stable traveling productivity waves.

This means that first customer 1 must be serviced, then customer 2 must be serviced, then customer 3 must be serviced and so on.

The demand of each customer cannot exceed the vehicle capacity and the vehicle is allowed during its route to return to the depot to restock with items of both products. The travel costs between consecutive customers and the travel costs between the customers and the depot are known.

Managing energy consumption more sustainably and efficiently is one of the most significant challenges for a growing society in the twenty-first century. In recent years, consequently, the consideration of energy consumption has been gaining increasing importance in all industrial planning processes. Logically, there is also a limited set of papers dealing with different aspects of energy consumption as well as energy costs in scheduling. Overall, three different approaches can be identified. In detail, the energy consumption can be reduced by specific planning, time-dependent electricity cost might be exploited or the peak power may be decreased. In contrast to the majority of energy aware scheduling models these ideas are adopted simultaneously in the proposed new extensive MILP formulation. In order to affect peak load and energy consumption variable discrete production rates as well as heterogeneous parallel machines with different levels of efficiency are considered. As a result, the interdependencies of different energy aware scheduling approaches can be shown. Furthermore, a multi-criteria objective function is proposed. Besides total completion time, time depending energy costs and the peak power are minimized. It can be shown that there is a dilemma between peak power minimization and demand charge reduction. A compromise proposal is given for this contrary effect. Since this problem is NP-hard, the numeric example is not only solved by classical solver software but also by using a heuristic approach.

Constraints require that each utilization path is always assigned to a rolling stock, and that each rolling stock selects a particular series of utilization paths for the planning horizon.\r\nA column generation algorithm is developed to the above integer program, but it was found that the solvable length of the planning horizon was 5 to 7 days and inappropriate assignment schedules were generated due to end effects.  \r\nWe show that the model can be modified to alleviate these difficulties, and also that the repeated applications of the optimization model in the rolling horizon allow to generate a feasible assignment for a longer period of time, thus indicating the feasibility of the optimization approach. The modifications of the model is based on the idea of relaxing the constraints that each utilization path is assigned to a single rolling stock except for the immediate future, thus leading to a mixed set covering/set partitioning formulation as opposed to the pure set covering formulation.

On the first level the model solves the infrastructure provider’s hub location problem that is deciding where to build additional transshipment terminals. Since this decision depends on the structure of the transports usually performed in the network, the second decision is to determine the mode of transportation for each order in a given set of typical transport orders.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a well-established non-parametric method to get such information for the activities of some comparable Decision-Making-Units (DMUs). It is well-known that this technique can be applied under the assumption of constant returns to scale (CRS) or variable returns to scale (VRS), respectively. In fact, if it is done under CRS, the returns to scale (RTS) for each activity equals one. More precisely: an input change results in an equiproportional change of outputs. However, in case of variable returns to scale the situation might be different; now the respective input variation can lead to a proportionally less or even higher output change. But often it becomes clear that the determined RTS-value is - from a decision-maker's point of view - unrealistically high (or low) and thus impracticable. Therefore, a new approach to treat this issue will be presented.

Customers arrive successively and stochastically over time with each customer purchasing at most one unit of a product. Within the booking horizon, the firm can continuously adjust the availability of the products by means of capacity control. Service provision takes place after the booking horizon, using several substitutable resources. However, if reservations cannot be fulfilled with the available resources, denied boarding penalties are incurred. Thus, the subsequent decision problem is to minimize the overbooking costs.\r\nThe above joint capacity control and overbooking problem is particularly relevant for the car rental industry, where the products are provided using a number of substitutable car types. Denied boarding penalties are incurred, for example, if cars must be transferred to the rental station or customers must be denied.\r\nWe model the problem as a stochastic dynamic program, using a recursively formulated value function.

Thus, an evenly distributed power consumption over time is much cheaper that having high peaks and low valleys, according to the typical electricity contracts of big consumers. Our approach consists in adapting a tentative timetable by shifting the departure times of the trains by few minutes.

In this problem, each flight is associated with linear delay costs and a departure condition. Furthermore, flights have to satisfy sector and aerodrome capacity constraints. Since conflicts involve at least two flights, there is a coupling between variables. Each potential conflict is modelled by a linear constraint, which assigns conflict costs by setting a conflict variable. However, conflict constraints of lp-relaxed variables do not trigger their conflict costs. Therefore, branch-and-bound nodes do not contain costs for relaxed conflicts, which weakens lower bounds.

Electricity represents one of the major costs for the smelter and in this work we examine how the electricity procurement scheme may affect the shutdown risk. The problem is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty: electricity prices, aluminium prices and currency exchange rates, whose dynamics is captured using forward curves models. The operational flexibility for the smelter is given by i) operating full load, ii) mothballing for up to 3 years, or iii) closing down, with irreversible switching costs for shifting between modes. For a given set of electricity procurement contracts, an operating policy maximizing the smelter value can be found by solving a stochastic dynamic program with the least-squares Monte Carlo method. On the other hand, the sourcing problem consists of a portfolio optimization problem of different short- and long-term electricity contracts, aimed at minimizing a trade-off between electricity cost and Conditional Value-at-Risk. In this work we formulate the joint stochastic optimization problem of smelter operations and electricity sourcing. The combined model is benchmarked against settings where the electricity demand from the smelter is assumed to be constant when sourcing, or where sourcing and smelter operations are solved in a sequential manner, i.e. an operating policy for the smelter is used as basis for electricity demand in the sourcing problem.

We investigate the deployment and relocation of several semi-mobile processing facilities in order to supply a large coal-fired power plant with high-quality renewable energy carriers. Semi-mobile facilities are characterized by a containerized design and can be relocated in case of changes in supply and demand. The energy carriers which are produced by different types of semi-mobile technologies are bulky goods with high density and properties comparable to those of coal and fuel oil. Thus, intermodal transportation is required to achieve transportation costs which are competitive with the delivered cost of fossil fuels at the plant’s gate. The optimization of the investigated supply chain therefore requires simultaneous planning of semi-mobile facility deployment and intermodal transportation. To this end, we present a mixed-integer linear problem which optimizes the number of semi-mobile facilities, their respective relocation over time and the intermodal transportation of produced energy carriers to the power plant. In the presented case, train transportation is characterized by a low geographical coverage of the railway network and restrictions representing minimum shipping volumes per railway line.

The problem in its original form consists of determining the fleet of OSVs and their corresponding weekly routes and schedules that minimize the total chartering and operating costs. The SVPP is closely related to the periodic vehicle routing problem, except for that in the SVPP each route will typically span two to three days. Furthermore, Statoil maintain the given weekly schedule for a longer period until some changes in input parameters occur, such as for example the arrival of new drilling rigs that require services. The planners then need to update the existing plan. An important requirement is to keep the new plan as close to the previous one as possible with respect to at which days the offshore installations get services.

We characterize Dantzig-Wolfe reformulations not yielding a stronger LP relaxation (than the edge formulation) as reformulations where this subgraph is bipartite. Furthermore, we analyze the structure of (critical) facet-graphs (i.e., graphs that define facets) of the stable set polytope and present a characterization of Dantzig-Wolfe reformulations with the strongest possible LP relaxation as reformulations where the chosen subgraph contains all odd holes (and 3-cliques).\r\n\r\nThese results motivate the investigation of Dantzig-Wolfe reformulations obtained by (heuristically) searching for edges that are contained in an odd hole (or a 3-clique) and convexifying the corresponding constraints. We discuss algorithms to calculate such reformulations and present computational results using the generic branch-price-and-cut solver GCG. In particular, we examine the reformulations in relation to other reformulations computed by GCG and draw a comparison to solving the initial integer programming formulation with the branch-and-cut solver SCIP.", :title "Dantzig-Wolfe Reformulations for the Stable Set Problem", :keyword2 150, :authors (42315 14969), :session 58}, 421 {:keyword1 61, :keyword3 100, :abstract "Algebraic Modeling Languages (AML) are one of the success stories in Operations Research.

In Baden-Württemberg around 24% of all GPs will retire in the next eight years. These almost 2000 GPs are looking for a successor for their practices as well as for their patients. Underlining the current situation, in the next eight years at least 500 practices will probably be closed as there are too little successors, leaving 750.000 patients with the need to find a new GP. Main reasons are that many newly qualified GPs are more interested in an employment or sharing a practice than having their own. Especially female doctors demand possibilities for part-time employments. With 70% of all GPs being female doctors they build the majority of future GPs. Due to the demographic change rather more than less GPs will be needed in the future to provide close to home primary medical care for the German population. One idea to overcome this challenge is to build new group practices for 4 (or more) GPs that allow for (part-time) employments. In this work we present planning problems when building new group practices and discuss corresponding formulations and solution approaches.

While product life cycles are becoming shorter, the differentiation of products grows. This leads to uncertain product demands in time and location. In contrast to large commodity markets, where a vast amount of orders compensates variation in demand, this does not apply for niche markets.\r\nDue to low production flexibility and long time to markets, large-scale conventional plants are not well suited for production in these highly volatile markets. The focus of research therefore shifts to modular production units, which can be installed in standardized transportation iso-containers. Using modular units, the supply chain design is becoming more flexible, as production locations can be located in direct proximity to resources or customers.  In answer to short-term demand changes, modifications to capacity can be made by numbering-up containers. Utilizing modular production units, the structure of the production network requests dynamic adaptions in each period. Subsequently, once the customer demand realizes, an optimal match between available production capacities and customer orders has to be determined. This decision situation imposes new challenges on planning tools, since frequent adjustments of the network configuration have to be computed for a large amount of specialty products based on uncertain demand.\r\nTo cope with uncertainty we develop different mathematical models.

Much human cooperation occurs where it is risky to cooperate for mutual benefit, because successful cooperation depends on sufficient level of cooperation by others. Here we show that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide that mediates complex mammalian social behaviors such as pair bonding, social recognition and aggression, causally increases human’s willingness to engage in risky, mutually beneficial cooperation. In two double-blind experiments, male participants received either AVP or placebo intranasally and made decisions with financial consequences in the “stag hunt” cooperation game (example of an coordination game). AVP increases humans’ willingness to cooperate. That increase is not due to an increase in the general willingness to bear risks or to altruistically help others. Using functional brain imaging, we show that when subjects make the risky stag choice, AVP down-regulates the BOLD-signal in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a risk-integration region, and increases the left dlPFC functional connectivity with the ventral pallidum, an AVP receptor-rich region previously associated with AVP-mediated social reward processing in mammals.

In addition to walk-ins there are patients who book their appointments in advance (preschedules).

First concepts of interday appointment schedules exist in literature and increase patient as well as PCP satisfaction  to a limited extent. While the occurrence of preschedules can be assigned to appointment slots, walk-in patients join the clinic uncontrolled.

An industrial company is considered that owns a gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant. To ensure a stable heat and power supply, the amount of gas needed to operate the CHP plant must be available at any time. Natural gas can be procured by signing supply contracts or by engaging in the natural gas spot market.

The extreme point of this development will be a one-piece flow model where the production plan considers each single product individually.\r\nHowever, different products (variants) differ in their configuration and thus may also differ significantly in the induced workload. To reach a production plan where the work intensity of all products lies within a limited range, manufacturers with a heterogeneous portfolio have to outsource some assembly steps to pre-levels. In this way, a constant speed on the main assembly line should be reached by shifting variances in work intensity to pre-production lines. These can be organized in one or several levels.\r\nAs for lean manufacturing systems only very small intermediate buffers exist (if any), the temporal distribution of workload in these pre-levels is strongly affected by the production sequence of the main line. Therefore smoothing pre-level workload needs to be respected in sequencing the main assembly line.\r\nConsidering the real-world application of assembling engines and gearboxes in a large Austrian manufacturer, a MILP-model for optimizing sequences in a mixed-model multi-level assembly line production system is presented.

There are several strategies which have emerged under the topic of remanufacturing in order to exploit the remaining economic value from these products. The efficient disassembly plays a key role in enabling these potentials or limit the losses resulting from the duty of disposal. This study represents a novel approach to combine the problems of disassembly sequence planning and machine scheduling. In this context, we assume a shop of several non-identical stations which are available for the complete disassembly of a given set of heterogeneous products. The problem is to simultaneously determine the sequence of disassembly operations for each product and the order of products at the stations with the objective of minimizing makespan. The approach taken in this study presents some similarities to existing formulations in the field of job shop scheduling with alternative process plans. However, the proposed model explicitly considers divergence of the product structure as inherent feature of disassembly. That is, separate sub-assemblies of the same product may be disassembled at the same time meaning operations of the same job can possibly overlap in the schedule. Therefore, we derive a graph-based representation which incorporates both alternative and parallel operations for each product.

We investigate an exact approach based on the horizontal bar relaxation (HBR), in which a rectangle is represented by a unit-height item-type with demand corresponding to the rectangle height. The items are packed into one-dimensional bins and the aim is to minimize the number of bins used to meet demand of all items. Which items are placed in one bin is represented by a one-dimensional pattern. That continuous linear problem is solved by column generation. A stronger relaxation of the SPP is provided by the contiguous bin packing problem, in which all items of one item-type have to be placed in consecutive bins. Thus, we try to generate a set of consecutive patterns, called sequence, that contains all items. For that purpose, we add constraints to the master (HBR) which ensure that if a pattern, belonging to a sequence, is used in the solution all predecessors and at least one follower are used too. In the slave, we generate continuing patterns that are 2D-feasible, which means that every set of contiguous patterns represents a feasible partial 2D packing. To reduce the number of variables and constraints, we exclude sequences depending on lower bounds and sequences that represent identically shaped partial 2D packings.

Instead of using a heavy truck to carry only a light payload the usage of a light vehicle can lead to reduced fleet fuel consumption since the movement of the dead weight of a light vehicle requires less fuel than the movement of the dead weight of a heavy truck. Since the payload capacity of a light vehicle is low and since the marginal fuel consumption induced by each additional payload ton is large (compared to a heavy vehicle) the length of a route assigned to a light vehicle is relatively short compared to the distance of the route assigned to a heavy vehicle. Therefore, a light vehicle can process two or even more round trips starting and ending in the depot while a heavy vehicle is still processing its only route.

In contrast, measures explicitly describe technological and organisational changes in a production system.

A solution then consists of a solution for the undisturbed case that can be made feasible for each scenario by applying a given, simple recovery algorithm.

The resulting complex design problems are best addressed by employing mathematical optimization. However, energy demands and prices are usually uncertain. Assuming certainty for the data yields suboptimal or even infeasible solutions: If energy demands are higher than assumed during design, a lack of supply occurs for the optimal solution. To incorporate uncertainties in the optimization to guarantee security of energy supply, robustness concepts can be employed. However, strictly robust solutions are very conservative in general and often expensive.\r\n\r\nWe propose the Two-stage Robustness Trade-off (TRusT) approach to design energy supply systems that are both cost efficient and strictly robust. The TRusT approach is based on bi-objective optimization evaluating the trade-off between nominal costs and robust costs. Thereby, the TRusT approach reflects the inherent two-stage nature of energy system optimization: The first stage is the design of the energy system; the second stage determines the operation of each unit in the system and can be adapted to the occurring scenario after the design is fixed. The TRusT approach evaluates how strictly robust designs perform in the nominal and the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nIn a real-world case study, we identify a strictly robust design which increases the nominal total annual costs only by 1.2 % compared to the nominal optimal design.

Given a capacitated network with a dedicated source and sink, a flow on source-sink-paths is re-routable if after failure of an arbitrary arc in the network, we can re-route the interrupted flow from the starting point of the failing arc to the sink only using residual capacities in the remaining network. We distinguish two variants, depending on the definition of residual capacities: For a strongly re-routable flow, the re-routing can only use capacities that have not been used at all by the original nominal flow. For a weakly re-routable flow, we can additionally use all capacity used by flow that traversed the failing arc before. \r\n\r\nWe show that a strongly re-routable flow of maximum value can be found using a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum weakly re-routable flow is NP-hard in general, even when all capacities are 1 and 2. However, for the case of unit capacities, we can show that every weakly re-routable flow can be transformed into a strongly re-routable flow. We also devise a surprisingly simple combinatorial algorithm that decides whether we can send a unit-value weakly re-routable flow. A consequence of this algorithm is that if the answer is yes, there always exists a half-integral solution.

Linear scalarization methods capable of yielding nonsupported efficient solutions introduce new (knapsack-type) constraints to the combinatorial structure.

According to patient conditions, an assessment of medical history is required and tests may need to be performed before a decision on treatment and further management of the patient is made. As individually required care is often not known in advance, a well-balanced skill set across members of clinical staff is essential to provide care both effectively and efficiently. In our study, we focus on a genitourinary medicine clinic in the South West of England as an example for an NHS walk-in centre. The clinic offers both appointment and walk-in sessions and sees approximately 18,000 patients per year. In general, long wait times due to high patient numbers are compounded by bottlenecks accessing appropriately skilled staff and properly equipped rooms. Many patients require multiple services which often remains unknown until a patient is triaged or a clinical assessment takes place. Due to a high level of discretion, effective streamlining of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is difficult. In order to improve waiting times for patients and to manage staff workload, changes to the existing pathways have been proposed, such as fast-tracking non-symptomatic patients and integrating existing services. A discrete event simulation model captures the current flow of patients at the clinic taking into account available resources.

Natural sites for PSH power plants are scarce, and likely to encounter substantial public resistance. Abandoned open pit mines are thus interesting candidate locations that may not face as much public resistance as greenfield projects.

In Variant 2, the lower basin is established as a tank under the pit lake which is used as the higher basin. In the model-based analysis, we apply the NPV method, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation (to account for electricity price uncertainty). Variant 1 shows that a PSH plant can be constructed at reasonable costs and operated at low unit production costs.

Simulation studies show that increasing the flexible use of beds by creating ward cluster can reduce shortages up to 95% within a year. A cluster is defined as a class of wards where patients can be admitted if the proper ward has no idle bed capacities.\r\nTo prevent disadvantages like long travel distance for staff or creating new bottlenecks on other wards good transfer decision strategies are needed. Based on a classification of possible transfers regarding range and dimensionality deterministic and stochastic criteria for these strategies are analyzed by simulating given cluster scenarios. Technical compliance and physical distance of the wards are examples of deterministic criteria while the estimated amount of patients and their length of stay are examples for stochastic criteria. It is expected that these criteria will affect the rating of the cluster scenarios.\r\nIn order to evaluate transfer decision strategies based on these criteria we discuss a possible enhancement of our generic simulation model facing the complexity of hospital-wide relocation processes. Our approach is based on a combination of discrete event simulation and optimization techniques like stochastic programming or linear programming. By using standardized real world data of a hospital we are able to receive practical relevant results and furthermore our approach can easily be reused in other hospitals.", :title "A generic simulation based DSS to evaluate patient transfer decisions strategies in hospital ward clusters", :keyword2 97, :authors (52468 19902), :session 125}, 606 {:keyword1 174, :keyword3 44, :abstract "Logistics and transportation play an important role in international trade relations.The international trade is one of the complicated interactions between people, firms, and organizations, whereas supply chains cross countries and regions. Competiteveness of the countries on a global scale is affected by unsatisfactory systems of transportation, logistics and trade-related infrastructure. The Logistics Performance Index is an interactive benchmarking tool and it measures logistics performance of countries according to six indicators which are customs, infrastructure, international shipments, logistics quality&competence, tracking&tracing and timeliness. The LPI was first published by World Bank in 2007 and then repeated in 2010, 2012, 2014. The LPI is performed a worldwide online survey on responsible of companies based on 5-point numerical scale to evaluate logistics performance of countries around the world. The LPI consists of two parts: International LPI and domestic LPI. The World Bank’ LPI and its indicators help to understand and identify the challenges and opportunities of the countries that they face in their performance on trade logistics and what they can do to improve their performance. The LPI allows leaders in government, business, and civil society to better evaluate the competitive advantage created by good logistics and to understand the relative importance of different interventions. The aim of this study is to propose multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods for ranking the countries with respect to the logistic performance index regarding six indicators.

Given the sequential nature of routing problems, we can update the knowledge over this factor each time a customer is visited and its true demand observed. This is accomplished by applying Bayesian learning methods. Based on the demand model we propose a stochastic dynamic programming algorithm to compute an optimal restocking policy. Such technique is common in a priori routing problems. In our case we augment the state set to incorporate the information about the external factor. We also generalize the traditional approach by considering unbounded demands. \r\nWe formalize the finite-horizon Markov decision process behind the restocking decisions and the dynamic programming algorithm, and transform this model into an equivalent linear program.

Note that while these observations typically hold for all types of scheduling, they are particularly important in personnel scheduling due the multitude of rules governing the schedule legality: For example, local rules governing the legality if consecutive pieces of work lead to the fact that the end of the scheduling period has a huge impact on the first days of the following period. In addition, period-transcending rules lead to the fact that in each period (e.g. a week), the effects of a schedule on larger time periods (e.g. months) need to be considered. In particular if the demand in future planning periods is subject to uncertainty, an interesting question is how to account for these effects when optimizing the schedule for a given planning period. The resulting planning problem can be considered as a multistage stochastic optimization problem which can be tackled by different modeling and solution approaches. In this work, we compare deterministic lookahead policies in which a given scheduling period is extended by an artificial lookahead period. In particular, we vary both the length and the way of creating demand forecasts for this lookahead period. The evaluation is carried out using a stochastic simulation in which demands are sampled and the scheduling problems are solved exactly using MILP techniques.

These characteristics may in turn restrict a vehicle's ability to carry out a particular service, which leads to site-dependencies in the corresponding VRP and affects a vehicle’s competitiveness. Given the competition among vehicles, it is investigated which price a vehicle should choose to maximize its own profit and to which extend heterogeneity of vehicles influences this decision.

Ideally, each particle in image A is assigned to exactly one particle in image B, and in an optimal assignment, the sum of shift distances of all particles in A to particles in B is minimal.

The deployment of mega-vessels has added further challenges to container ports to cope with the surge effect of container flows. In addition, traffic congestion and emissions caused by truck movements in the surrounding area of seaports have raised serious concerns to the society. Rail transport is regarded as an effective way to tackle the above challenges due to its high capability and low emission. Therefore, improving the efficiency of rail terminal operations at seaports is essential to ensure the sustainability of global container transport chains. This study aims to investigate and improve the efficiency of container loading process at a seaport by optimising the container pre-staging and flow rates in the process of moving containers from storage yards to the train. \r\nWe will formulate the problem into a stochastic dynamic programming model. The decision variables include: the pre-staged number of containers from storage yard to rail terminal buffer; the dynamic flow rates from yard to buffer and the dynamic flow rates from buffer to the train within the time window. A case study will be constructed based on the data from a real container rail terminal. Numerical experiments will be performed to illustrate the effectiveness and the sensitivity of the model and the results.\r\nOur model is able to balance the container pre-staging decision and the container flow rate control within the time window. In addition, the model can dynamically determine the optimal container flow rates from storage yard to rail terminal buffer and from rail terminal buffer to the train by taking into account the uncertainties in the handling activities.\r\n ", :title "Optimal dynamic assignment of internal vehicle fleet at a maritime rail terminal with uncertain processing times", :keyword2 165, :authors (1292 35540), :session 1211882}, 686 {:keyword1 59, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In order to maximize retail profits, retailers regularly determine how items should be allocated to retail shelves. One common characteristic in existent shelf space literature is the assumption that customers have a frontal perspective on shelves and observe only the foremost unit of an item, i.e. the facing. This implies that retailers must decide how to allocate the one-dimensional, front-row space by positioning different items side-by-side, but not behind one another. These types of optimization models are applied to standard supermarket shelves for the ambient assortment. However, there are other types of shelves which allow retailers to position two different items not only side-by-side but also behind one another. Examples are tilted shelves for meat, bread, fish, cheese or clothes. Customers have a total perspective on these shelves and can observe facings horizontally and vertically. This adds another degree of complexity to the shelf-space planning, because of the two-dimensional space restriction and shelf quantities need to be presented in a rectangular form. We develop the decision model, which optimizes the two-dimensional shelf-space assignment of items to a restricted, tilted shelf. We account for stochastic demand and space-elasticity effects. To solve the model we develop a genetic algorithm.

The self-generation of households turns them from passive consumers of electricity into active “prosumers” (consumer-producers).

Consequently, it is economical to maximize the self-consumption of PV electricity. Following this opening wedge between purchase cost and remuneration, the number of battery systems in private households in Germany has risen sharply in the recent past. \r\nThe focus of our research is the analysis of the economic merit of a virtual aggregation of spare capacities (unused storage capacities) from those batteries. We refer to the resulting capacity as cloud capacity. To this end we develop a MATLAB model that simulates battery state-of-charge values resulting from PV generation and load profiles for individual prosumers. We then define a geographically separated decision-maker (independent prosumer, without a battery system), who demands the spare battery-capacities of those households in order to maximize the self-consumption quota. We simulate an entire year and determine sensitivities with regard to electricity transport costs, feed-in tariffs, operation strategies and electricity prices.

Biofuels derived from biomass can play a crucial role as one of the main sources of renewable energies. As logistics may represent 50% of the biomass cost, it is necessary to design efficient biomass supply chains to provide bio-refineries with adequate quantities of biomass at reasonable prices and appropriate times. The task is challenging since, contrary to industrial logistics, the raw materials (oilseed and lignocellulosic crops) are produced slowly, seasonally, and with a limited yield, over vast territories. In particular, a refinery must use successive crops during the year, e.g., miscanthus (a kind of cane) in Spring, rape in July, cereal straws in August, camelina in October and short rotation trees like willows in Winter. The paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to optimize a multi-period and multi-biomass supply chain for several bio-refineries, at the tactical decision level. The locations of refineries can be fixed by the user or determined by the model. The aim is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain, including biomass production, pretreatments (e.g., pelletization), storage, handling, bio-refineries setup and transportation, while satisfying given refinery demands in each period. The model determines the amount of biomass produced, shipped and stored during each period as well as the number, the size and the locations of bio-refineries.

As opposed to traditional transshipment concepts, mobile deconsolidation points have minimal infrastructure requirements and can be dynamically (re-)located to match transportation demands.

In order to minimize the total cost of a supply chain, multiple agents have to coordinate their decisions. In this setting, our focus is on a distributed capacitated multi-level lot-sizing problem which has to be jointly solved by multiple agents. \r\nTo solve this problem, we developed a negotiation scheme. Agents negotiate a contract which consists of delivery dates for each item. Rotationally, agents propose contract modifications. Based upon a given contract proposal, an agent identifies an item with a high potential for cost savings within her schedule. She proposes a corresponding modification of the contract; the other agents re-evaluate the modified contract and indicate their preferences for it via voting. Concurrently, each agent reveals changes in her local costs. Based on these, payments are collected which can be used to compensate some agents for deviating from their local optima. In order to calculate the actual side payments, a technique from cooperative game proposed by Aumann and Maschler in 1985 is used. In contrast to other mechanisms, there is no requirement to publish production setup decisions or production cost per item, and the side payments are based upon game-theoretic procedures.

Production stages are linked by intermediate storage tanks with limited capacities. This study has specifically focused on a number of industry specific characteristics (e.g. shelf life, intermediate storage, multi-stage processing, continuous flow, production bottlenecks, available connections, dedicated production lines, setup times, and costs). The key decision variables of this process are: the quantity of intermediate products, SKUs processed on resources in each time period, waiting times as raw milk and intermediate products on resources, quantity of SKUs sold; quantity of SKUs held in inventory, lost sales of SKUs, and time consumed by resources. The objective is to maximize the total profits based on sales revenue from the products against the costs, such as setup, inventory holdings, lost sales, and production costs.

Vehicle routing with time-dependent service costs was first introduced as the vehicle routing problem with general time windows.

For a planning horizon of one day, usually three shifts and thus three trips are planned. This is the second enhancement, usually called the vehicle routing problem with multiple trips. As the third enhancement, we are given a maximum shift duration as input. So each trip must not exceed this duration. Also, drivers have to respect break and rest rules. For instance, the regulation 561/2006 of the European Union states that after driving for at most 4.5 hours, drivers have to take a break of at least 45 minutes.

To treat the huge size of the networks under consideration, we develop an exact spacial decomposition based on graph aggregation. The idea is to solve the problem over a coarse network representation obtained via a clustering of the nodes to components and to refine it iteratively where needed. The result is a cutting-plane method whose cutting-planes dominate the Benders feasibility cuts. Both ideas are easily transferrable to more general network design contexts.

On a bottleneck segment, concurrent traveling of vehicles in opposite direction is restricted. Single tracks in railway planning are a typical example. This work is motivated by and considers in particular the ship traffic at the Kiel Canal which connects the North and Baltic Seas and is operated bidirectionally. Since ships register their travel requests only on short notice, the planning of the Canal's ship traffic additionally features the requirement that decisions must be adapted online.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic for bidirectional traffic is that vehicles moving in the same direction can enter a tight lane sequentially with relatively little headway while vehicles in opposite direction must wait until the whole lane is empty again. With a compact scheduling model that accurately accounts for this specialty, a detailed analysis of the problem's off- and online complexity is accomplished. To deal with open gaps between upper and lower bounds on optimal competitive ratios in the online setting, a new concept for its approximation is presented. Finally, combining the scheduling perspective with a dynamic routing approach yields a performant heuristic to tackle complex ship traffic control instances.\r\n", :title "On- and Offline Scheduling of Bidirectional Traffic", :keyword2 0, :authors (26629), :session 1211978}, 771 {:keyword1 101, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The presented research addresses the integrated segmentation of supply and demand with service differentiation by means of service-level menus. To this end, it establishes a joint perspective on the market side - that is, prices and service levels - and the operations side - that is, the inventory management policy and the corresponding parameters. This joint perspective comprises analyzing when the introduction of a service-level menu increases profits over those of a single undifferentiated offering and how to design optimal service-level menus. Surprisingly, in many cases service differentiation does not increase profits significantly. One way to interpret this finding is that differentiating customers based on service levels alone is a weak differentiation lever only, that is, the price differences between offerings with differing service levels need to be small in order to prevent customers from switching to offerings with lower prices and service levels. Therefore, successful price differentiation requires service differentiation's being supported by presence of additional conditions or measures (e.g., pricing restrictions or further differentiation levers). Indeed, it is possible to show that service differentiation can significantly increase profits if the company experiences pricing restrictions.\r\n", :title "Integrated Segmentation of Supply and Demand with Service Differentiation", :keyword2 0, :authors (36303), :session 1211978}, 772 {:keyword1 54, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This Master’s thesis is concerned with integrated location-inventory optimization in spare parts networks.

The resulting model is a mixed integer linear program (MILP) which integrates (1) strategic facility choice, (2) tactical base-stock level setting and (3) operational sourcing decisions. The three-layered decision model exploits the potential benefits associated with pooling inventory physically or sharing inventory virtually among multiple facilities during the design phase of a supply chain network. Due to the model’s special structure and its linearity, Benders’ decomposition (BD) is applied to solve the problem. Several valid inequalities are added to the master problem in order to expedite convergence of the BD algorithm. Furthermore, we address the issue of combinatorial complexity inherent in large-scale SMDPs and thus, propose an exact method to effectively reduce the SMDP state space in each BD iteration. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of BD in comparison to the brute-force approach branch and bound (BB). Furthermore, experimental results emphasize the value of the integrated MILP compared to the sequential ’location first, inventory and sourcing second’ approach.

One substantial result is that all three compact models are equivalent by successive linear transformations, some of which are even unimodular. For their LP-relaxations, however, equivalence does not hold in general and we deduce a complete inclusion hierarchy under these transformations. It turns out that our new model supersedes the previous compact models in terms of polyhedral strength. Furthermore, we reveal that the time-indexed model is obtained from the new compact model by subsequent expansion and projection.\r\nSince the LP-relaxations of the compact models are weak in general, we further propose a linear programming extension.

The type and frequency of disasters changes (e.g. due to climate change and urbanization) and technology offers new perspectives (e.g. social media or drones). It is therefore important to ask the question whether current research is relevant and impactful, and what are burning research questions.\r\nHumanitarian Operations take place in specific contexts that are often very different from commercial operations: destroyed infrastructure, failing information systems, insufficient funds and assets, dynamic and chaotic situations, multiple stakeholders with diverging objectives, conflicts and fighting parties, security issues, and so on. It is therefore crucial to understand the impact these contextual elements may have on the problem at hand and whether our standard OR tools are readily applicable or not.

In this model, every agent participating in the market has an initial endowment of some goods and a utility function over sets of goods. Goods are assumed to be divisible. The market clears at a set of prices if each agent can spend its entire budget (= the total value of its goods at the set of prices) on a bundle of goods with maximum utility, and all goods are completely sold. Market clearing prices are also called equilibrium prices. In the linear version of the problem, all utility functions are linear. For the case of linear utility functions, Walras' model is also known as the linear exchange economy. \r\nWalras argued the existence of equilibrium prices by describing an iterative improvement algorithm. However, his argument was incomplete. A convincing proof of existence was only given in the 1950 by Arrow and Debreu. The proof is non-constructive. Starting in the '70s, the quest for algorithms arose. The first algorithms were exponential. Later, polynomial time algorithms were derived based on the formulation of the problem as a convex program and the use of the Ellipsoid or the interior point method. \r\nIn the technical part of the talk, we describe a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for computing equilibrium prices. We formulate the problem as a network flow problem in which the prices are modeled as capacities. We show that the problem can be solved by an iterative algorithm. In each iteration, we first adjust the prices and then compute a maximum flow. The adjustment of the prices is based on a careful examination of the current maximum flow. \r\nWe also report on an implementation of the algorithm. \r\n(joint work with Ran Duan, Jugal Garg, and Omar Darwish).", :title "Network Flow and Equilibrium Computation in the Linear Exchange Economy", :keyword2 0, :authors (52829), :session 1211981}, 779 {:keyword1 154, :keyword3 0, :abstract "k-OPT is one of the most popular local search heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). k-OPT tries to improve a suboptimal tour by removing k of the edges and by reconnecting the resulting tour pieces into a new tour by inserting k new edges. \r\nIn the talk, I will mainly concentrate on the question whether a given tour is a local optimum for k-OPT (where k is some fixed, small number), and I will present a fine-grained complexity analysis of this problem.", :title "New answers to old questions on the TSP", :keyword2 0, :authors (55926), :session 1211987}, 780 {:keyword1 101, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The increasing environmental awareness drives a growing interest among companies for more sustainable supply chain operations.

The goal in multiobjective optimization is to find the best possible solution in the presence of several, conflicting objective functions. Using mathematical tools we can define a set of Pareto optimal solutions where none of the objective function values can be improved without impairing at least one of the others. However, we need additional preference information from a domain expert, a decision maker, to find the most preferred Pareto optimal solution as the final solution to be implemented. Multiobjective optimization methods can be classified according to the role of the decision maker in the solution process. We concentrate on interactive methods, where the decision maker takes actively part in the solution process and directs the search for the final solution according to her/his desires and hopes. This enables the decision maker to gain insight about the interdependencies of the conflicting objectives and learn about one's own preferences.\r\nTypically, interactive methods deal with Pareto optimal solutions only and the decision maker must trade-off to be able to move from one Pareto optimal solution to another. To avoid this need of trading-off, a family of NAUTILUS methods has been proposed. In NAUTILUS, the interactive solution process begins from an inferior solution and the decision maker can gain improvement in all objective functions and direct the solution process until (s)he reaches the set of Pareto optimal solutions. In this way, (s)he can move more freely without anchoring around any solution. We introduce a new method called NAUTILUS Navigator which incorporates the NAUTILUS philosophy with elements of the Pareto Navigator method. With NAUTILUS Navigator, the decision maker can navigate in real time towards the set of Pareto optimal solutions and continuously see how the region of objective function values that are reachable without trading-off shrinks. The distance to the set of Pareto optimal solutions is also shown. Thanks to the graphical user interface, the information is available in an understandable form. The decision maker can provide preference information to direct the movement as desirable aspiration levels and bounds that are not to be exceeded. The decision maker can change the navigation direction at any time and even go backwards if needed. \r\nThe NAUTILUS Navigator method is also applicable to computationally expensive problems where function evaluations are time-consuming.
