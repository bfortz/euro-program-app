airports is one of the main challenges confronting controllers in the near future. The most important factors in the aircraft landing modeling are time and cost. The Aircraft Landing problem (ALP) is a typical hard multi-constraint optimization problem.  In real applications, it is not most important to find the best solution but to provide a feasible landing schedule in an acceptable time. Our study first presents a brief review of the aircraft landing problem. Then we propose a formulation of the problem as a mathematical programming model in order to reduce the number of constraints (which can positively reduce the computing time) and to give a more rigorous formulation. The model was introduced to solve this problem by using penalty functions and MATLAB programming solutions and scenarios by which we can control then a model for the problem is then introduced, and possible solution approaches are discussed.", :title "Multi-Objective Mathematical Modelling for Aircraft Landing by Simultaneous Minimization of Time and Cost ", :keyword2 96, :authors (35488 35495 35496 39672), :session 389}, 880 {:keyword1 17, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This paper investigates the relationship between the dynamics of price discounts at the dealership level and to product efficiency in the Spanish auto market. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), product efficiency scores are estimated for 2092 different vehicles commercialized during 2010, using an innovative database that accounts for more than 75 technical attributes of each model. By alternating the official and the discounted prices within the DEA specification, we are able to propose a measure of product efficiency improvement in the marketplace. This measure is further decomposed into two indexes that measure the “commercial effort” of the dealer and the “intensification of competition” that results from the discounting practices of the set of all dealers. Finally, we explore the relevance of some drivers of dealership discounts, with the focus on product efficiency. As expected, the results confirm a strong inverse relationship between product efficiency and dealer discount. Also as expected, discounts are larger for generalist brands, aged models and gasoline engines. In contrast, car size is found to be positively related to the magnitude of discounts, which was an unexpected result, although it has also been reported in previous research about the European auto market.

The efficient ones are presented to the decision maker, and he is asked to choose the best one out of them.\r\nThen, the hypercube serves as a cut-generating set. The generated cut cuts off only those feasible integer points that have been enumerated before. Comparing the best feasible integer solution found so far with the (non-integer) vertices of the facet generated by the cut allows us to decide whether to stop the process or not. If the best feasible solution it preferred to the best vertex of the facet we can assume that under rather customary conditions the best solution is found. \r\nOtherwise, the best vertex of the facet is used as the next basic solution of the lp-relaxation and another iteration is performed. \r\n", :title "An enumerative cutting plane approach to integer linear vector optimization problems.", :keyword2 77, :authors (4686), :session 263}, 884 {:keyword1 45, :keyword3 59, :abstract "When the number of available beds in a hospital is limited, it can be beneficial to cluster several clinical departments such that the probability of not being able to admit a patient is acceptably small. However, not all clinical departments can be clustered as e.g. surgical patients can easily get an infection from one of the non-surgical patients. In addition, patients from one clinical department should not be spread out over the entire hospital as this complicates the process of doing rounds. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we consider a situation where wards with a fixed amount of beds are given. The question is how to cluster the clinical departments and to determine the assignment of these clustered departments to the available wards such that enough beds are available to guarantee a blocking probability below a prespecified percentage. We first give an exact formulation of the problem to be able to achieve optimal solutions. However, computational experiments show that the resulting computation times for this method are too long for this method to be applicable in practice. To reduce the computation time, we introduce two heuristic solution methods. The first heuristic uses the same formulation as the exact solution method, however, the number of beds needed is approximated by a linear function. The resulting model is again solved by an exact solver. The second heuristic uses a restricted version of the exact solution method within a local search approach. Hereby, the local search is used to determine the assignment of clinical departments to clusters and the exact method is used to determine the assignment of clusters to wards.", :title "Clustering clinical departments for wards to achieve a prespecified blocking probability", :keyword2 77, :authors (31214 8513), :session 395}, 902 {:keyword1 8, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The classical Hospitals/Residents problem (HR) models the assignment of junior doctors to hospitals based on their preferences over one another.

Such a situation is undesirable as it could naturally lead to r and h forming a private\r\narrangement outside of the matching.\r\n\r\nThe original HR model assumes that preference lists are strictly ordered. However in practice, this may be an unreasonable assumption: an agent may find two or more agents equally acceptable, giving rise to ties in its preference list. We thus obtain the Hospitals/Residents problem with Ties (HRT). In such an instance, stable matchings may have different sizes and the problem of finding a maximum cardinality stable matching is NP-hard.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we provide an Integer Programming (IP) model for HRT. We show that an exploitation of the structure of the problem can be used to greatly reduce the size of the model it produces.

As grid utilization is based on market results, a realistic power market simulation is crucial. The proposed approach determines the most cost efficient power plant schedules for all European countries, taking into account the cross-border electricity exchange. The simulation is split into three stages:\r\nIn the first stage the international electricity exchange between the European countries is calculated by means of a linear network flow model, where each country represents a network node. The NTC (Net Transfer Capacities) are used as capacities for the network’s edges. The first stage considers time coupling ramping constraints and the maximum power output for thermal generators. Hydro storage is also integrated into the LP.\r\nBased on the first stage results the countries can be separated from each other by summing up the national power demand and import/export in order to calculate the national residual power demand to be covered by the national generators. Thus the second stage focuses on each national power system. Langrangian Relaxation in combination with MILP is applied in order to solve a highly accurate UC and Economic Dispatch for each European country considering also spinning reserve requirements.\r\nIn a third stage the integer decisions for all generators (obtained from stage two) are fixed and - based on the Unit Commitment – again an integrated European network flow (from stage one) is solved in order to consider the integer decisions within the energy exchange calculation.\r\nFinal results are hourly schedules for each generator and price signals taken from the Lagrange Multipliers in the second stage.\r\n", :title "Multi Level European Electricity Market Simulation using Network Flow Algorithm and Lagrangian Relaxation", :keyword2 0, :authors (39052), :session 366}, 922 {:keyword1 6, :keyword3 8, :abstract "Recently, a number of countries have introduced the combinatorial clock auction (CCA) to sell spectrum.

Different kinds of neighborhoods are employed during the search: small (basic moves), medium (compound moves), large (tree-search moves).

Such models therefore consist of non-linear as well as non-differentiable parts in its problem formulation, leading to mixed integer non-linear programs (MINLP).\r\nWe present a combined scheduling and capacity planning model for a hydrogen - ammonia concept, which has been developed together with ThyssenKrupp Uhde, an ammonia plant engineering company. The model is formulated as a MINLP. Due to convergence problems of the MINLP two heuristic approaches for approximation have been developed and will be presented. These approaches decompose the MINLP to refrain from one of the two aspects, solve the simplified program as either differentiable non-linear or mixed-integer linear problems and feature a post-optimisation adjustment for meeting the previously allowed discrepancies. By using best- and worst-case scenarios for the simplifications, upper and lower bounds of the MINLP objective value can be derived.\r\nBoth approaches will be compared with regard to the way they influence the simplified optimum and especially the post-optimal adjustments.

Solving such MILPs can be done by standard solvers, or using more specialised algorithms based on e.g. decomposition methods. Independent of the algorithm, in general the more binary variables are needed to describe the problem, the longer it takes to compute the (optimal) solution.\r\n\r\nAt the basis of many problems is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Key elements of the TSP are the decision variables that define the order in which the cities are visited. These variables use two indices to represent whether or not the salesman will travel from one city (the first index) to another (the second index). As a result the amount of binary variables grows quadratically with the number of cities in the problem.\r\n\r\nWhen considering multiple salesmen starting from (and returning to) multiple locations one has to distinguish the routes of the individual salesmen. Often this is done by adding an extra index to the decision variable that identifies a salesman. This results in a cubic growth of the number of binary variables, thereby making the problems inefficient to solve. \r\n\r\nFor problems with multiple entities (people, vehicles, etcetera) or multiple periods the three-index formulation of the multi-depot TSP (MTSP) is often at the basis of the MILP formulation.

In addition to the case with optimal capital structure, we analyze a case with financing constraints that require firms to finance investment costs by debt. Notably, financing constraints can delay preemptive investment and improve firm values in preemptive equilibrium. Indeed, the leader’s high leverage due to the financing constraints can lower the first-mover advantage and weaken preemptive competition.

In equilibrium, we illustrate that the retailer's profits are increasing in her own creditworthiness and in her supplier's debt capacity. Hence, she has an interest to collaborate with a financially strong supplier. In contrast, we find that the supplier may be at a disadvantage when doing business with a highly creditworthy retailer, since the latter may reduce her purchase order commitment and extract profit from the supplier.

First, it has to decide on the optimal time for market entry; and second, the optimal stocking quantity needs to be determined. Obviously, the firm faces a two-fold tradeoff between stocking too much and too little, and launching the product too early and too late.\r\nWe show that the firm always stocks less than a standard newsvendor if the selling season is uncertain. Additionally, if the timing uncertainty exceeds a moderate level, the firm completely forgoes any sales and leaves the market. In contrast, if the firm decides to launch the product, then it either enters the market at the very first opportunity, or it takes a substantial risk of being late. Apart from holding costs, we identify opportunity costs as a crucial driver for this behavior. Lastly, we show that the firm’s optimal decision is non-monotone in both, production and opportunity costs.", :title "Serving an Uncertain Season: When and How to Enter the Market", :keyword2 99, :authors (39314 4229), :session 361}, 981 {:keyword1 91, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Remanufacturing restores the functionality of a used good for another life cycle. In the context of complex durable goods the term regeneration is used as a synonym for the term remanufacturing. These goods, such as aircraft engines, are owned by the customers of regeneration service providers. Different regeneration modes can be applied in order to regenerate those goods. On the one hand, these modes can be distinguished based on resource consumptions, durations and costs. On the other hand, these modes have a different impact on the good’s functional features, e.g. energy efficiency. Depending on the customer-specific business model the appreciation of selected modes varies in different customer types. Hence, the willingness to pay and simultaneously the service providers´ contribution margins depend on the ability to address the customers´ specific needs.\r\nSimilar to Revenue Management (RM) applications in a make-to-order (MTO) environment, regeneration service providers have to decide whether to accept or to decline incoming regeneration requests. The reason is that they have only limited short-run capacities. Hence, providers are confronted with the problem of pricing and capacity control. Where the afore-mentioned RM application in a MTO environment deals primarily with new products, in the regenerate-to-order (RGTO) environment used products with individual conditions are addressed. These conditions are not known with certainty in advance.

The story begins with the world modeling projects conducted in the early 1970s by the System Dynamics Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During the late 1970s John Sterman, an MIT Ph.D. student, was hired by Roger Naill to work with a team to modify and extend the FOSSIL1 model into the FOSSIL2 model. In the early 1980s, system dynamicist George Richardson met a British petroleum analyst who claimed that the \"amount of oil in the world is increasing.\" Naill and Hubbert’s work formed the basis for Sterman, Richardson and Davidsen’s synthetic data experiments on analyzing techniques for forecasting the ultimately recoverable amount of oil in the world and in the United States, while knowledge of the weaknesses in the FOSSIL2 model caused Sterman to investigate the dynamics of energy-economy interactions during the energy transition. Fiddaman’s recognition that, although the source constraints on the energy-economy system had been investigated by energy modelers, sink constraints had not, lead to the creation of the FREE model. The world modeling projects also stimulated the study of the US electric power industry by Andrew Ford and the subsequent EPPAM models and their offshoots.

The investment and dispatch model minimizes the system relevant costs and includes a DC approach of the German transmission grid. Considering technical and economic constraints the electricity demand at each grid node has to be satisfied by either electricity transfer via the transmission grid or electricity generation in existing or newly build power plants. Because of the ambitious target of the German government of more than 60 % generation out of renewables in 2040 and the resulting capacities the generation of renewables has either to be cut in hours with a higher supply than demand or the electricity has to be stored. Therefore, we integrated storage extension options (chemical batteries and potential hydro storages) at each grid node. To prevent that storage systems store and generate at the same time, using their efficiency to destroy electricity in order to minimize the costs of load changes by thermic generation units binary variables are needed. As of the high computing times that comes with the implementation of such a high number of storage systems the optimization model is solved twice. Once as a linear problem with ideal storages (100 % efficiency) to preselect possible storage allocation and the second time as mixed integer problem with real storages.

With costs, consistent prices are bounded by the superhedging price from above and by the maximum amount one can borrow against the claim from below.\r\nHow can we find a consistent price system? In an incomplete market without transaction costs, consistent prices for financial derivatives can  be obtained by taking expectation of the claim with respect to some martingale measure.

A well known approach is to find the growth optimal portfolio as candidate for the numeraire portfolio, but the numeraire portfolio in the strict sense (i.e. generating a martingale measure) might not exist. \r\nUsing methods from dynamic programming, in a discrete-time market with independent stock returns it can be shown that a numeraire portfolio under proportional costs exists which leads to a consistent price system.

The interest in the modeling and analysis of social networks lies in understanding phenomena that are typical for these networks. Communication in a social network often involves repeated transfers of knowledge among large numbers of agents, and fully rational learning becomes infeasible. Nevertheless, agents may use fairly simple updating rules for their beliefs and still arrive at outcomes like those achievable under fully rational learning. In the seminal paper of Golub and Jackson (2010), simple updating rules are introduced based on DeGroot (1974) such that an individual places her trust on the current beliefs of her neighbors in the social network and forms her own belief for the next period by taking the weighted average of her neighborhood. They formulated conditions about network structure under which the beliefs converge to the true state when the network is growing in size. Such a social network is said to be wise. One shortcoming of their paper is that they assumed that the network grows according to fixed pattern. In this research, we relax this assumption and study the case when the network structure is occasionally perturbed by a shock, i.e. we study mixtures of wise networks and non-wise networks. As we will show, a wise network remains wise under mixture with an arbitrary (non-wise) network provided the rate of a shock satisfies certain conditions.

Hence blowout prevention equipment is critical infrastructure for drilling companies. Drilling companies attempt to prevent blowouts through blowout preventer (BOP) valve networks. BOP valves are high pressure valves that can be closed rapidly. In a BOP valve network, BOP valves are arranged in a primarily series-parallel configuration which can contain any unwanted influx from a well-bore and divert it though manifolds away from the rig to be released in a safe and controlled manner. Once the influx is contained, the valves are returned to their original configuration so that normal drilling operations can continue. The advantage of a series-parallel structure is that it allows, if any of the valves leak, fail or wear out,  to continue to deal with the influx in a controlled fashion while the leaking or worn out valves are repaired or replaced. Typical BOP valve networks have between 10 and 50 BOP valves. Since BOP valves are critical pieces of equipment, they need to be checked regularly. However, since these valves are often physically inaccessible, they are checked in batches called test sets.

Due to this effect, an optimal number of classes exist, minimizing the unit load retrieval time. The results also show that, compared to a parallel aisle layout, the fishbone aisle layout brings shorter retrieval time but needs more storage space. For a given number of items in the warehouse, our aim is to determine which aisle configuration should be chosen and how many classes should be adopted to minimize annual operational cost. The optimal class boundaries can be found through dynamic programming. Including cost of space, the optimal number of classes is smaller than when only travel-time would be taken into account. Furthermore, fishbone aisles are superior to parallel aisles for large-size warehouses or in case of low annual costs of storage space.

The item that is replaced is called the line replaceable unit (LRU), and the so-called LRU-definition problem is the problem of deciding on which item to replace upon each type of failure. When a replacement action is required in the field, one option is to replace the failed item itself, but another option is to replace a parent assembly that holds the failed item. Items that are located deep in the indenture structure are typically smaller and have lower holding costs. On the other hand, replacing these items can require more maintenance resources, and longer time to identify and isolate failures. The reverse effects occur when replacing assemblies higher in the indenture structure. Therefore, defining what to replace is fundamental to the trade-off between maintenance costs and availability of the capital asset. We consider a fleet of assets (e.g., trains) so that we can improve the probability of having a sufficient number of assets available by acquiring additional assets. The objective of the LRU-definition problem is then to minimize the total costs of item replacement and the investment in additional assets, given a constraint on the availability of those assets.

When the slower transportation mode is less-polluting, higher inventory levels need to be kept. Both the choice for a clean but slow transportation mode and consolidation of shipments requires higher inventory levels because of longer intervals between deliveries. \r\nIn this paper, we consider a vendor who decides on the degree to which deliveries to geographically dispersed retailers should be consolidated.  The vendor has the option to ship to several retailers during a joint delivery; such a group of retailers is called a zone. Such a consolidation of a shipment has the advantage that frequent joint deliveries can be made, but has the disadvantage that each delivery tour is long and overall emissions can be high. On the other hand, deliveries to small groups of retailers are less frequent, but have shorter delivery tours and may have lower carbon emissions. \r\nFor different values of the transportation costs per kilometer, we determine a minimum cost solution for the vendor using a Joint Replenishment Problem approach.  Carbon emissions are computed from both the daily driven distance and the ton kilometers using an advanced engine emission model. \r\nWe find that, for products with frequent demand, an increase in transportation costs leads to lower fuel usage and carbon emissions, as it is not costly to increase inventory levels at the retailer. However, for products with infrequent demand, this is so costly that the optimal strategies and hence, carbon emissions, remain more or less unchanged.

To quantify the latter, we develop three definitions of the coverage score of a truck driver with one of the four diseases. In each definition, the score depends on the travel time intervals between adjacent healthcare facilities that offer the required services along the truck driver’s route.

We use a coupling argument for shortfalls while establishing the stability conditions, which will, by itself, render the Harris ergodicity of the shortfall process.\r\n\r\nWe show that the stability condition suffices to ensure that the shortfall process possesses the regenerative structure of a Harris ergodic markov chain. Under a stronger condition, we establish that the vector of shortfalls returns to the origin infinitely often, with probability one.\r\n\r\nWe show that the necessary stability condition is also sufficient for any sort of re-entrant system, in the presence of random yield, provided the control policy is in P2.", :title "Stability of re-entrant flow lines", :keyword2 99, :authors (39375), :session 360}, 1085 {:keyword1 101, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We study the inventory control problem of a retailer working under stochastic demand and stochastic limited supply.

As it may not always be optimal for the retailer to replenish the backordered supply, we also consider the setting in which the retailer has a right to cancel these backorders, if desired. For both policies, we show that the structure of the optimal inventory policy is a base-stock policy where the base-stock levels are equal in both cases. The optimal base-stock levels are thus independent of the starting inventory position and the backordered supply from the previous period.

The problem is to partition these m sets of vectors into n m-tuples so that no two vectors from the same set are in the same m-tuple and so that the total cost of the m-tuples is minimized. The main motivation comes from a yield optimization problem in semi-conductor manufacturing. We consider two classes of polynomial-time heuristics for MVA: sequential heuristics (among which the heaviest-first heuristics) and the hub heuristics, and we study their performance ratio. In particular, we show that when the cost function is monotone and submodular, sequential heuristics, as well as hub heuristics, have finite performance ratio for every fixed m. Moreover, we establish a better ratio for heaviest-first heuristics when the cost function is additive. We provide examples to illustrate tightness of our analysis.

Their customers frequently emphasize on logistics performance in addition to product quality. In order to remain competitive various decisions, which are strongly influencing each other although referring to different planning levels, have to be made carefully. This is mainly induced by an increasing level of uncertainty involved in longer planning horizons. Coordination between decisions taken on different levels can be approached by implementing a hierarchical planning system. A challenging task in this context is to determine good production parameter settings in order to benefit from well-known planning methods. We present a framework for hierarchical production planning in a make-to-order environment which we use to identify good settings for three planning parameters, namely planned leadtimes, safety stock, and lotsizes. Within a discrete-event simulation which mimics the production system we use a mathematical optimization model for replicating the decision problem. This mathematical model is solved to optimality using a standard optimization engine. We use data referring to four different demand market situations in order to derive general statements concerning the quality and sensitivity of the three analyzed planning parameters. For exploring the parameter space we follow the concept of simulation-based optimization.

We extract the solutions where it is possible to alter the timetable while keeping engine routes intact. The Crew Scheduling model is allowed to use sub-optimal solutions if the additional cost is outweighed by the crew savings. This information is implemented in a mathematical model for the Crew Scheduling Problem. The model is solved using a column generation scheme.

This is a non-trivial task because in the MTDP at least three resources are needed, and two resources depend on each other in a non-additive and non-linear way. To obtain lower bounds, we present a new relaxation for the MTDP with only one resource, which is attractive due to its low computational complexity. This and other relaxations can be combined with the ng-tour relaxation and the ngL-tour relaxation. To improve the lower bounds, we use two methods: First, we adapt a penalty method.

Next, we extend the model to include a fixed order cost.\r\n\r\nWhen demand is backordered in case of a stock out, it is well known that an order-up-to policy is optimal and the inventory position (on-hand inventory plus inventory on order minus backorders) is used as main indicator of the inventory status. The optimal replenishment policy for lost-sales inventory systems is not of such a simple form. Even when there are no fixed order costs, there are hardly any analytical results on the optimal policy let alone when a fixed cost is incurred with each order. \r\n\r\nSince it is computationally intractable to find the optimal replenishment policy for lost-sales inventory systems, most papers propose heuristic replenishment policies. Such simplified policies are usually suboptimal with respect to total expected costs. In this paper, we develop myopic replenishment policies that only grow linear with the lead time such that the policy can be computed very efficiently, and they can be used in settings without or with fixed order cost. In particular, myopic policies are very useful when demand is non-stationary or changing over time, since no steady-state analysis needs to be performed and only the demand over a limited time horizon is taken in consideration.

In their representation as maps on the variable values they can be extended to symmetries acting on the polytope.\r\nIn this talk, we describe a method for dividing the inequalities into equivalence classes without resorting to a normal form. To do this classification, one applies the symmetries to the facet-defining inequalities and then checks whether any two facets can be transformed into each other and hence belong to the same class. Often, this check is not so easy as two linear expressions describing the same facet might differ by the sum of multiples of several equalities from the problem description.\r\nThe main idea is to identify every facet defining inequality with the vertices of the polytope which satisfy it with equality. With this method, complete descriptions of polytopes can be analyzed to divide the facets into equivalence classes according to groups generated by given symmetry mappings.\r\nWe propose an algorithm for the classification and illustrate its efficiency on a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems including the TSP and the Linear Ordering Problem.

For each job some parameters, such as a processing time, a due date and a weight are specified. The cost function depends on job completion times and can be, for example, the weighted sum of completion times, the maximum weighted tardiness, or the weighted number of late jobs.  In real life the precise values of the parameters are often unknown before a solution is computed. To model this uncertainty, we can introduce a scenario set containing a finite number of distinct  vectors of the parameters, called scenarios. We can then apply the popular robust optimization framework to choose a solution. In robust optimization we seek a solution minimizing the cost in the worst case, i.e. under the worst scenario which may happen. We then typically apply the minimax criterion which is, however, often regarded as too pessimistic or conservative. To overcome this drawback we propose to use the ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator (shortly OWA), introduced by Yager in 1988. The OWA operator contains the maximum, minimum, average, median, and Hurwicz criteria as special cases. It is thus more flexible and allows us to model different attitudes of decision makers towards the risk. Our aim is to show some complexity and approximation results for a class of sequencing problems with uncertain parameters and the OWA criterion.

Demand fulfillment in this ATO case is still little investigated and differs remarkably from the more popular Make-to-Stock (MTS) case: Bottlenecks are the assembly capacity and the stocks of components, which are “available to promise” (ATP).

Given the cost and demand information of each customer, the response to a discount can be computed.

First the problem for each customer is solved, giving their cost. The suppliers' problem is now to minimize its cost, plus discounts offered to the customers. The discounts are a lump sum that would compensate the customer for ordering at the periods requested. The discount offered in periods with production can now be calculated to achieve the wanted order pattern.\r\nThis approach can be useful in situations when the buyer represents a retailer with his own customers which is unwilling to introduce discounts to them.

However, ships can encounter delays both when they are sailing between ports and when they are berthing in a port. When ships arrive delayed, the berthing schedule of a port has to be adapted, which results in additional costs for the liner shipping company. Furthermore, a delayed ship will have a higher probability of arriving delayed in the next ports to visit. The incurred delay can increase during a round tour, because new delays are encountered or because delayed ships have to wait until the berths are free before they can enter the port. Therefore, it is important for liner shipping companies to develop robust shipping routes.\r\nShips can reduce their delay by taking recovery actions against certain costs. Examples of recovery actions are: increasing the sailing speed or port handling capacity. Furthermore, buffer time can be incorporated in the route to capture the delay. The goal of the ship delay recovery problem is to determine a recovery policy and buffer time allocation that minimizes the costs associated with delays and recovery actions for a given route. The ship delay recovery problem with fixed buffer times can be formulated using a Markov decision process. The states of the Markov process denote the position of the ship and the amount of delay encountered by the ship with respect to the original schedule. In each state, it has to be decided which recovery action is performed. The buffer times can also be modeled as actions in a Markov decision process.

Slabs leave the casting process at a temperature of about 1000°C and cool down during the following transportation and storage processes. The cooling curve is non-linear and thus the temperature loss is highest in the first hours after casting.

Nevertheless, they neglect the continuous, non-linear cooling curve in favor of highly aggregated cooling assumptions.

In the algorithm of the log likelihood maximization, Quasi-Newton method or steepest descent method is widely used. However, the log likelihood function of the GNL model is multimodal. Therefore, the result of the parameter estimation depends on its initial setting when we use those methods and it is possible that we find local optima.\r\nIn this study, we improve real-coded GA to the parameter estimation of the GNL model in order to find quasi-optima in each estimations from different initial setting. Real-coded GA has three operators, 1) crossover operator, 2) selection operator and 3) mutation operator. In the first operator, we apply simplex crossover (SPX). However, when we apply SPX to the GNL model which has constraints in allocation and logsum parameters, there is a possibility of making offsprings which violate constraints. Therefore, we propose a method to recalculate if offsprings do not satisfy constraints. In the second operator, we propose reJGG based on just generation gap (JGG).

In a region, degree of collapse risk is different in different locations and some roads may not be adequate for evacuation. So, the shortest route from a point to the site may not be the best route.

We present an integrated vehicle and crew scheduling approach with the possibility to shift scheduled trips within defined time windows. In addition to minimizing vehicle and crew costs the approach aims at building robust schedules by minimizing the expected overall propagation of delays through the transport network. Two concepts are combined: The consideration of mutual dependencies between vehicles and drivers by integrated scheduling allows inserting buffer times at appropriate positions into the vehicle and crew schedules to minimize delay propagation. Further, the possibility to shift scheduled trips within small time windows offers additional degrees of freedom to distribute buffer times into the vehicle and crew schedules without increasing costs. The integrated problem with time windows is solved with column generation in combination with Lagrangian relaxation.

An important role on these inland waterway networks is reserved for locks, which allow control over the water level while, at the same time, allowing ships to move from one side of the lock to the other. Depending on the position of a lock and the decisions that govern the lock behaviour, ships may experience some waiting time before they can pass the lock. We are interested in finding an operating schedule for a lock so that the total waiting time of all ships is minimized. The goal is thus to find the moments in time when the lock should switch positions, and to decide which ships should be handled at each of these times. The basic problem for a single lock is polynomially solvable. We investigate two relevant extensions. We first consider ship-dependent handling times; we assume that the time needed to change the lock increases with each ship that is in the lock, and that this handling time for each of the ships may be different. We show that the problem becomes NP-hard under this setting. Next, we restrict ourselves to first-come first-served policies: when multiple ships are waiting at either side of the lock, we require that these ships must be handled in the order of their arrival. We show that this particular case does admit a polynomial time algorithm.

RPM is one of the buyback contacts, which coerces publishers to buyback unsold magazines at wholesale from book stores. In 2008, the RSS could be adopted to the magazine industry because of high ratio of returned unsold magazines via RPM. Under the RSS, publishers need to buyback unsold magazines at lower price than wholesales. However, it is not obvious that the RSS ensures Pareto improvement from other contract. There are optimal buyback price and amount for publishers and desirable ones for book stores.\r\n\r\nWe employ a real option game approach in order to analyze supply chain contracts. In this analysis, an optimal design of buyback contract, buyback price and amount, is emerged as a result of a subgame perfect equilibrium in a leader-follower game between a publisher and a book store. Under this approach, a Geometric Brownian Motion is adopted to demand of magazines. Many studies in supply chain contracts assume that demand follows independent and identical normal distribution in each period. Obviously, this character cannot sketch demand for magazines, which has non-negativity and high serial correlation.\r\n\r\nWe conduct sensitivity analyses with actual parameter sets via numerical calculation.

In a dynamic order picking system (DPS), an order picker picks orders in batches that arrive in real-time during its picking cycle, which subsequently changes dynamically the order picker's current picking route.

Social network analysis is an example where clusters, e.g., formed by members of a community, are studied using cliques and clique relaxations. A clique is a subgraph with pairwise directly connected nodes, i.e., a subgraph with diameter one. Several relaxations have been defined either in terms of distance (k-clique), degree (k-plex, k-core), diameter (k-club), or density. The majority of the literature deals with identifying such subgraphs of maximum cardinality or weight. In this presentation, we consider the problem of covering or partitioning a graph with a set of k-clubs. Note that a k-club is a subgraph with diameter at most k. For k=1, the clique partitioning problem results, which is equivalent to the graph coloring problem in the complement graph. For k>1, however, covering and partitioning are properly different problems because a subset of a k-club is not necessarily a k-club again. We present an exact solution approach to the k-club partitioning and covering problems based on column generation. Herein, the subproblem consists of finding a k-club of maximum weight. We present heuristics and a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for its resolution. The most interesting part of the branch-and-price is the branching scheme. We will derive branching rules that together guarantee integer solutions.

Compared to the RCPSP, the scheduling of operations is less challenging since each route-specific scheduling can be made individually. We introduce the VRSP with Coordinated Operation Starting Times (VRSP-COST). Two types of requests must be served. A regular request is assigned to exactly one vehicle but a flexible request is assigned to two vehicles. A customer site associated with a flexible request is visited by two vehicles. It is necessary to coordinate the operations of these two vehicles at the customer locations, i.e. time constraints between starting times of the (un)loading operations must be kept. In a typical applications it is necessary to schedule the arrival times of all vehicles at a customer node within a period whose length does not exceed a given threshold (e.g. two vehicles must be unloaded in short succession in order to avoid costly cleaning or refitting of the handling equipment). We investigate the situation of the VRSP-COST in which the second vehicle serving a flexible request must arrive at the associated customer location within the implicit time window implied by the vehicle arriving firstly at the customer.

Efficient and variable combined heat and power (CHP) plants are used to fulfil the unsteady, usually asynchronous loads for heat and residual power whereby electricity may also be traded on the spot market. Additional flexibility can be gained by the use of heat storages to decouple production from demand. This allows a power price-oriented operation of the CHP plant to realise profits.

Vehicles are loaded onto special motorail transportation wagons under several specific constraints, e.g. weight, width, height and other limitations. Due to an increased capacity demand of vehicles, for example due to growing popularity of SUVs during the past 50 years, the present capacities of transportation wagons become a critical issue. Especially the combination of increased vehicle weights and heights raises the complexity of the vehicle loading problem.\r\nMuch research effort has been spent on container terminal optimization. Motorail terminals differ from these terminals regarding layout, storage space and transport goods. The main goals in motorail terminal optimization consist of determining a feasible loading for a set of vehicles on a given train and the minimization of shunting operations at the terminal. Vehicle specifications are known, but the order and time of vehicle arrivals at the terminal are uncertain in advance. As storage spaces are limited and shunting operations become more time consuming with increasing terminal utilization, it is preferable to load arriving vehicles on the train as soon as possible. Vehicles have to be assigned in a way minimizing capacity waste such that later arriving vehicles can still be loaded, even in the case of deviations from prespecified characteristics.\r\nWe will present a new optimization approach finding a compromise between early loading and minimal capacity waste adapting the relevance automatically to the current situation.

We propose a white-box optimization by mapping a learned regression tree model to a mixed integer linear program that can be used for optimization. In a regression tree each leaf represents a value of the dependent variable, whereas the path from root to the leaf illustrates the values of the independent variables. Consequently, the learned models properties are visible as constraints to a mathematical problem solver, that can then use sophisticated branching and cutting techniques on these constraints when finding solutions, which are impossible in black-box optimization.\r\n\r\nWe illustrate our approach using a sequential auction design problem.

Moreover, today many companies interact more intensely with their customers, and they also focus on more local production again.\r\nIn this context, the remanufacturing of returned products can be an attractive sourcing option. Locally producing companies with a high level of costumer participation have more information about the returned product, especially about its condition. Moreover, the modular design of the product facilitates the disassembly and the re-integration of remanufactured items into the production system. \r\n\r\nIn order to control inventories and to plan production for such systems, multistage models are required. Hence, a discrete Markov decision modeling approach for an open tandem system with two stages, i.e. component production and final assembly, is proposed in this work. It consists of single inflexible machines at both stages, with a buffer at the first stage and component inventory holding at the second stage. Remanufacturing and manufacturing are considered as sources for the second stage, on which the machine works demand-driven, thus starting to work only when demand arrives and if enough components are in stock. The objective of the approach is to find a strategy that coordinates the input of the system such that expected total costs are minimized. This strategy determines whether to accept an arriving remanufacturable product, and when to restock component inventory by (re-)manufacturing. \r\n", :title "Optimal control of a hybrid production system for customized products with combined manufacturing and remanufacturing", :keyword2 0, :authors (30076 20937), :session 346}, 1289 {:keyword1 98, :keyword3 57, :abstract "AIMMS GMP library offers a fine-grained control over the generation, manipulation and solution of a Math Program instance.

On the one hand, vehicle route planning methods should become faster to cope with growing problem sizes. On the other hand, there is a strong wish for more elaborate vehicle routing models to cope with more real-life restrictions. Restrictions that require synchronization between vehicle routes, such as a limited loading capacity at a depot, are particularly challenging, for at least two reasons.\r\nFirst, an effective way to speed up vehicle routing methods is to use estimations for changes to the vehicle route plan, before evaluating them exactly. For example, when evaluating a move of a customer, the local change in distance may give a proper estimation of the quality of that move with respect to other moves. However, when synchronization constraints are present, a change in one route may lead to substantial changes in other routes. Therefore, coming up with strong estimations is in general difficult when synchronization constraints are present.\r\nSecond, this propagation effect of synchronization constraints may make exact evaluations of changes to the plan very expensive. In the worst case, a small change leads to a re-evaluation of the entire solution.\r\nIn addition to synchronization constraints, some other constraints have a big impact on solution methods for vehicle routing problems. For example, companies that transport animal feed face contamination constraints, such that certain orders may not succeed directly in the same vehicle. However, placing an extra order in between may be feasible. This makes the sequence in which a solution is built up very important.\r\nIn this talk, I will give an overview of the most important routing challenges we currently face in practice.\r\n", :title "Routing in practice: current major challenges", :keyword2 96, :authors (39430), :session 347}, 1291 {:keyword1 88, :keyword3 96, :abstract "The rapid growth of E-Commerce calls for new methods to operate warehouses.

Consequently, the user numbers decline rapidly. One way of obtaining a sustainable optimal pricing policy is to apply an infinite time horizon.

On this basis the specific interactions between forward flow, backflow and capacity utilization in closed-loop supply chains, and the implications of uncertainty can only be rudimentarily taken into account.

The most natural column-generation formulation for the PDPSDTW uses master program variables representing PDPSDTW-feasible routes. The resulting subproblem to generate such routes, however, is challenging. An alternative approach is to formulate the master program in relaxed routing variables that may violate one (or more) types of constraints relating to a single route. These constraints must then be handled by adding valid inequalities to the master program. The easier to solve subproblem in the latter approach comes at the cost of weaker master program lower bounds. Thus, it is a priori not clear which formulation is preferable. Our contribution is twofold: First, we devise a new labeling procedure to solve the natural PDPSDTW-subproblem allowing for an integer column-generation algorithm where all route constraints are handled in the subproblem. Second, we compare this algorithm to approaches based on alternative formulations in a computational study. These formulations use subproblems relaxing some route constraints and, hence, can be solved using more effective labeling algorithms. Preliminary results indicate that additional effort in the subproblem pays off in the overall algorithm.", :title "A Comparison of Different Column-Generation Formulations for the Pickup-and-Delivery Problem with Static and Dynamic Time Windows", :keyword2 95, :authors (29571), :session 391}, 1323 {:keyword1 77, :keyword3 53, :abstract "Supply chain management problems are an important class of real world instances and cover a wide range of applications.

The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan of the project. \r\nALNS is based on the principle that neighbors of a given solution are generated by applying different destroy and repair operators. The operators are selected randomly using a bias based on their performance in previous iterations. The destroy neighborhoods of our ALNS remove activities from the schedule mainly focusing on removing predecessor and successor activities at the same time. This is based on the idea that a schedule can only be sufficiently altered if the predecessors and/or successors of an activity can also be moved to other positions. To successfully reconstruct a partly destroyed schedule, our repair neighborhoods either rely on some state-of-the-art priority rules, a random selection or the current resource utilization of a schedule. Moreover, our ALNS is embedded into a simulated annealing framework, which governs the probability of accepting newly generated solutions.  \r\nTo evaluate the performance of our ALNS, we conducted tests on the well-known data sets j30, j60, and j120 from the PSPLIB.

As there are typically several outlets that are served by the same vehicle in the retail distribution, inventory and routing decisions have to be taken in an integrated way.\r\nThe purpose of our model is to make four decisions: to determine the time when the second delivery has to take place, to assign the customers to the given routes, and to determine delivery quantities for the first and the second delivery.

Techniques to solve those problems are very well studied and optimal flows can be calculated efficiently. However to realize the calculated flow in reality the flow has to be decomposed into paths which then are assigned to the units of flow. While it is straight forward to find an arbitrary decomposition it might not be unique and the choice of the decomposition can have a tremendous effect on the properties of the single paths.\r\n\r\nFor example consider an evacuation scenario where the overall exposure to a toxic substance is minimized and an optimal flow is computed. For one decomposition of the optimal flow, every person might be exposed to nearly the same level of toxicity, while in another, some persons are exposed to an unacceptably high degree. Note that although those two solutions are equivalent in terms of the total exposure to the toxin, they are obviously very different in quality.\r\n\r\nThis example illustrates the necessity as well as the potential use of a very rarely addressed type of optimization problem, which is optimizing over the set of all path decompositions of a given flow.\r\nIn this talk we focus on the problem of finding a decomposition minimizing the maximum costs of any path in the decomposition.

The occurrence of a critical fault triggers a rescheduling routine that solves the integrated production and transport scheduling problem (PTSP) for the running system, i.e. it was designed to take the current system status into account and reschedule only the remaining jobs.

Value driver trees are a common method to drill down the top-level metric into distinct performance levers.

Nevertheless, important aspects related to partial mutual knowledge of players in a dynamic context are not yet been studied. To fill this gap, we develop an extension of the static game to modelling highly polarized conflicts in an uncertain, asymmetric and dynamic environment. In this extension both parties bargain multiple negotiation rounds under uncertain threats that are materialised only if an agreement is not reached. If a negotiation breakdown occurs, each party learns about these threats from the outcome observed in the previous round.

One major drawback of DEA applications in university settings as well as in other areas is the dependency of efficiency results upon the number and configuration of included universities as decision making units. For example a given set of universities could identify one university as most efficient (100) - but as another, even more efficient university (DMU) is added all previous results may change and the newcomer may receives the singular 100-efficiency-leader-result. This cannot be avoided within the DEA method - but for practical applications i.e. in university research and management an indicator or metaheuristics regarding the impact quantification of such variation effects could be usefull in order to judge relative efficiency measures obtained from DEA calculations. \r\n\r\nTherefore this research contribution proposes to explore possible indicators for the result \"stability\" of DEA calculations by performing an iterative DEA scheme with more than 100 runs with university input and output data, starting with just 10 university DMUs and increasing the number up to 110. A second run will be performed with another add sequence of university DMUs in order to check for variances according to the sequence.

Two-type queueing models have been developed in order to experiment on the effects of customer misclassification on cross-training in call centers. Accelerating the time to identify calls as misclassified by adequate technology can be a significant cost saver, since similar performance can be achieved by partial cross-training as compared of a completely cross-trained workforce. If only a third of the agents is cross-trained, high increases in model performance can be confirmed, whereas little benefit is added by higher amounts of cross-training. In terms of customer abandonment, partial cross-training was found to outperform a completely flexible workforce. We conclude, that partial cross-training outperforms full cross-training from different perspectives. The assignment policy of calls in partially cross-trained systems strongly influences customer waiting times. Similarly, this result was achieved for a Markovian loss model with no waiting space.

Attacks by motivated threat agents, however, are much more difficult to deal with because these adversaries differ in resources, capabilities, as well as points of access, and they exploit multiple attack vectors to achieve their particular goals – frequently in unforeseen ways. \r\nWe introduce a simulation-based optimization approach that addresses the problem of assessing and improving the security of complex information systems, particularly against the latter type of attacks. To this end, we have designed and implemented a framework that integrates conceptual modeling of security knowledge, behavioral modeling of threat agents, discrete event simulation of attacks, and genetic algorithms to identify efficient portfolios of security measures. Based on a general model of security knowledge and a model of the information system to be protected, our approach simulates a large number of attacks on different system configurations and records various outcome metrics. Based on these metrics, we optimize the system with respect to multiple cost and benefit objectives (e.g., minimize cost, maximize detection of attacks, minimize expected impact on availability, integrity, and confidentiality of data etc.). Finally, we provide interactive decision support for the selection of a proposed efficient portfolio of security measures to implement.

This allows us to examine economical aspects for the usage of hybrid electric transporters and determine the point when they become profitable. Moreover, additional questions can be answered, e.g., whether a plug-in hybrid is reasonable for a specific tour profile or not.\r\nFor the HEVTSP we assume four different modes of operation: mere combustion, mere electric, charging while driving with combustion engine and combined combustion electric as a boost mode. The modes differ in costs and required travel time for each arc and a maximal tour duration has to be met. The assumption of four different modes of operation makes the problem very difficult to solve, as the number of possible solutions for the already NP-hard TSP is increased by a factor of four times the number of cities to be visited.\r\nTo be able to handle practical problem sizes, we develop a heuristic solution method based on Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and having the ability to deal with an exchange of the different modes of operation.

A company does quality control on the milk produced by farmers. For this quality control milk samples need to be collected. These milk-samples are obtained by special equipment.

Each vehicle departs from the home location of its driver, resulting in a heterogeneous vehicle fleet. Furthermore there are multiple depots, where the vehicles as well as the equipment for a specific farmer are linked to a single depot.

In this paper, a new mathematical model is proposed for the service network design. The model uses a combination of a path-based formulation and a minimum flow network formulation. It introduces two new features to the intermodal network-planning problem. Firstly, overdue deliveries are penalized instead of prohibited. Secondly, the model combines self-operated and subcontracted services. The service network design considers the network-planning problem at a tactical level: the optimal service schedule between the given network terminals is determined. The model considers self-operated or subcontracted barge and rail services as well as  transport by truck. The model is used for the service network design of the EGS network. For this case, the benefit of using container transportation with multiple legs and intermediate transfers is studied. Also, a preliminary test of the influence of the new aspects of the model is done. The preliminary results indicate that the proposed model is suitable for the service network design in modern intermodal container transport networks. Also, the results suggest that a combined business model for the network transport and terminals is worth investigating further, as the transit costs can be reduced with lower transfer costs.", :title "Service network design for an intermodal container network with flexible due dates/times and the possibility of using subcontracted transport", :keyword2 65, :authors (39614 39649 1752 39650), :session 385}, 1512 {:keyword1 18, :keyword3 55, :abstract "Corporate Environmental Management Information Systems (CEMIS) enable companies to provide the required environmental related information to various stakeholders on the basis of material and energy flows.

Modern CEMIS have to address this need for a strategic forecast which means they are also required to offer decision support tools.\r\nMulti-criteria decision aiding (MCDA) methods provide an appropriate way to analyze possible business actions.

While cooperative behavior has been identified to be a critical factor for on-time project completion, it has not been explicitly embedded into project management (PM) systems. Inspired by an innovative real-life new product development management practice, we model a PM system that incorporates and shapes project managers' cooperative behavior. Help is at the core of this system in which project managers may mutually ask for and provide help, while top management formally monitors the exchange of help. We find that the company should take a nuanced approach to the provision of help. In projects with a very low cost of effort, help is allowed to occur informally, that is, without top management's monitoring. For higher costs, the company benefits from shaping the compensation structure to monitor and reward help. Against all intuition, the company may prefer to avoid cooperative behavior in projects for which early completion benefits taper off quickly with decreasing earliness. Finally, it is striking that a natural order among projects emerges, even with symmetrical projects: cooperative behavior may lead the company to choose an equilibrium in which projects receive a different level of effort.

For the evaluation of optimal bidding and dispatch strategies or for the optimal use of power plants it is not only relevant to know the expected price. Especially for risk management issues it is more important to assess possible price variations and to get reliable interval price forecasts, e.g. to make right decisions about dynamic strategies or to find the value of flexibility and optionality. Therefore, forecasting electricity spot prices in practice has to meet three important requirements. (1) Capture the main characteristics of electricity spot price dynamics to deliver useful and reliable forecasting results. (2) Deliver not only point forecasts but also multivariate price distributions for valuation and bidding purposes. (3) Establish a parameter estimating and price simulation procedure that keeps time and effort small.\r\nThis work presents an applicable modelling procedure to describe the dynamics of hourly electricity prices. A stepwise combination of several mathematical operations is used to reach adequate distribution characteristics. One major element of the stochastic modelling procedure is to identify principal components of hourly electricity prices by using an eigenvalue-eigenvector de-composition. Moreover, non-normality of residuals is accounted for by performing normal quantile transformation. Another crucial step within the modeling procedure is to specify the stochastic process for the identified principal components.", :title "Forecating the distribution of hourly electricity spot prices", :keyword2 37, :authors (39724 24773 14799), :session 366}, 1523 {:keyword1 8, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Practical applications of combinatorial optimization often require\r\ndecision making under data uncertainty.

The\r\ngoal of two-stage robust optimization problems is to construct a solution in a two-stage manner that is feasible in all scenarios, i.e., robust\r\nagainst uncertainty, and we want to minimize the worst-case cost of\r\nthe constructed solution.

Restricting the set of possible scenarios is a common approach, but this\r\nusually depends on subjective decision criteria like the willingness to\r\ntake risks or the expectation on the future.

Emergency vehicles have to be positioned and repositioned such that emergencies can be reached within a legal time frame. Especially the use of flexible ambulance locations, e. g. hospitals or voluntary fire departments, can be useful to reach a suitable coverage.\r\nEmpirical studies have shown temporal and spatial variations of emergency demand as well as variations of travel times during a day. The numbers of emergency calls with respect to the 24 hours differ significantly between night and day and show peaks especially during rush hours. Existing models do not consider time-dependency of important model parameters as demand and travel times for EMS-vehicles.

The goal is to pack all of the boxes orthogonal oriented and without overlapping into the container, minimising its resulting height. The problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and, therefore, lower bounds are used to limit the optimal solution\r\nand to estimate the performance of some heuristic solutions. We present new lower bounds based on geometric considerations and derived from different relaxations of the mathematical formulation of the SPP3.

This dissertation makes several contributions to operational planning problems that are encountered\r\nin the pre- and end-haulage and at transshipment yards of intermodal transport. For each optimization problem, we state the relevant literature and present several mathematical formulations. Moreover, we develop solution approaches that are specially designed for the problems that arise in the context of intermodal transport, but can be applied to other areas as well. We address, for example, the problem of scheduling the container movements between customers and terminals under hard time window constraints and the simultaneous reposition of empty containers. We model this problem as a full-truckload pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows and develop a two-stage heuristic solution approach. A simplification of this problem can be modeled as an asymmetric TSP on a bipartite graph and as an integrated model that captures the problem’s assignment and routing structure. We solve the integrated model by the classical and the generalized Benders decomposition. The performance of our solution methods is evaluated on several computational studies.

On the example of a mid-term planning problem of assembly line balancing and a short-term planning problem of job rotation scheduling, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We show that it is possible to reduce and redistribute ergonomic risks at low costs with the help of assembly line balancing. Our designed two-stage heuristic procedure is able to lower the ergonomic risks to an acceptable level without increasing either the number of workstations or the cycle time for 50% of realistically generated instances. In addition, we present the ergonomic job rotation scheduling as another effective tool in balancing ergonomic risks among workers.
