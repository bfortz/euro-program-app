The time to failure and time to repair of the primary and standby components are assumed to be exponentially and generally distributed, respectively. The failed components join the retrial orbit if the server is busy or are repaired immediately. The time to retrial is assumed to be exponentially distributed. We adopt a recursive method that involves using the supplementary variable technique with the remaining repair time treated as the supplementary variable to develop expressions of the steady-state availability Av, for the four availability retrial models. For each availability retrial model, the explicit expressions of Av were developed for the three repair time distributions, namely exponential, three-stage Erlang, and deterministic distributions. The specific values of the distribution parameters and component costs are compared among the four availability retrial models. The four availability retrial models are ranked on the basis of Av and the cost–benefit ratio for three repair time distributions, where Av represents the benefit.", :title "Cost-benefit analysis of four availability retrial models with warm standby components and general repair times", :keyword2 89, :authors (549), :session 308}, 12 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 145, :abstract "A bridge of a network is an edge whose removal increases the number of components of the network. Though this concept captures the importance of edges through the effect of bridging, it is too restrictive as an importance measure function because of its binary value. We propose a new importance measure for edges capturing the bridging effect by focusing on cutsets, which are groups of edges whose removal together increases the number of components. We consider a random removal process of edges of a given network where in each step an edge is removed until there is no edges remained. Each realization of this process results in a series of growing cutsets. We define our measure as the probability that the edge under consideration becomes the one who completes the first (minimal) cutset in this process. We provide another equivalent definition by considering spanning subnetworks in a random reconstruction process of the original network. We then link our measure to the Shapley values of two simple games defined on the edge set of networks. Structural as well as game theoretical properties of the proposed measure are discovered, such as the normalization property, the bridge-get-the-most property, the auto-invariance property, etc. By utilizing the transfer property of the Shapley value of simple games, we also provide an alternative formulation of the proposed measure which in many cases leads to a great efficiency in evaluation.", :title "Bridging effect, simple games, and an importance measure for edges", :keyword2 42, :authors (56533), :session 665}, 13 {:keyword1 96, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We describe the effects of monster cell in flow shop scheduling with minimization of mean lateness.

However, they are computationally expensive, and an analysis of the obtained solutions is cumbersome for the Decision Maker (DM). This is why EMO algorithms that incorporate the DM’s preference information have gained in popularity during the last decade. Preference-based EMO (PEMO) algorithms aim to find an approximation of the Pareto front whose elements are scattered according to the preference information provided by the DM.\r\nHowever, nor EMO nor PEMO are not capable to ensure the approximation accuracy, which makes their usefulness questionable especially for real-world problems (where the true Pareto front is not known). \r\nIn our recent works, it was proposed to approximate Pareto fronts by two-sided approximations, one from inside and another from outside of the feasible objective set, called, respectively, lower shell and upper shell. Accuracies of Pareto front approximations by such pairs can be measured and controlled with respect to the distance between such approximations.\r\nHere, we propose a PEMO algorithm based on lower shell and upper shell paradigm. The algorithm was experimentally investigated by solving a set of benchmark problems and has shown promising results.

In many cases, this is a satisfactory approximation to real-life maintenance management. General repairs have an effect on the system to be maintained, which is ‘in between’ the effects of minimal repairs and replacements. This effect is measured by their respective degree of repair.

However, the history of warfare is punctuated by attempts to apply some elements of quantitative analysis to understanding the causes of victory and defeat. An example of new military practices introduced in the sixteenth century are innovations adopted by Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, in the period between 1585--1625, which included systematising loading and firing of matchlock guns into forty-two sequential moves, so that soldiers could fire more rapidly and in unison; another example being the military use of gunpowder in Roberto Valturio's ``De Re Militari'' (1486). A natural question then arises: were military practitioners of the sixteenth century simply following common sense, or did some of them follow a principled, scientific approach akin to the one in use today? In this work I argue that Tartaglia's ``La Nova Scientia'' (1537) represents an exception and should be, in fact, regarded as one of the seminal works in the field of OR, intended as the systematic application of the methods of science to complex problems faced in military operations.

Both retailers procure identical products from a common supplier and each consumer purchases from the closest retailer. Each retailer incurs transportation costs for inventory replenishment from the warehouse and consumer travels to the store. We consider two carbon tax schemes imposed on retailers: for supply-chain-related transportation and for consumer-related transportation. Our analysis indicates that intense competition between retailers leads to a “minimal differentiation”equilibrium, which substantially increases the total system emissions. According to our numerical experiments with realistic parameter values, carbon tax on supply-chain-related transportation does not affect retail location decisions. Carbon tax on consumer transportation, however, may effectively induce the retailers to approach the middle of their respective markets, reducing the total system emissions. Our analysis also indicates that a low carbon price, relative to market profitability, only reduces the total system profit without any effect on emissions.

Appraising performance incorporating multiple financial and economic performance measures together with measures of commitment to ethical issues such as environment, sustainability and governance (ESG) score is essentially an undertaking in a multi-dimensional framework. We develop data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to assess MF performance recognising that (i) ESG score reflects medium- to long-term corporate policy on ethical issues and (ii) MF portfolio construction and management may be conditional upon such corporate policy. We model this issue by conceptualising MF overall management process as a serially linked two-stage process (operational management and portfolio management) and treating ESG score as a fixed output at the first stage. DEA models assess overall and stage-level performance and thereby reflect relative performance from two different aspects of MF management. For MFs deemed inefficient, we propose a procedure that provides information as to how inefficient MFs may reach the frontier of best performance.

The paper explores the use of cutting and packing methodologies in a new and innovative way to support archaeological research. Pre-hispanic cultures in Mexico used codices to register different aspects of their everyday life including their lands and crops.  Each family register the number of pieces of land that they owned together with some measures of its dimension in a codex. These codices have been deciphered and using the methodologies presented by Williams et al (2008) we have accurate information about the length of each side of the pieces of land and the area they covered. Using the given di-mensions, each terrain can be reconstructed as polygons. In addition, the dimensions and location of the settlements are known. This description equates to a two dimensional pack-ing problem with an irregular bin and irregular pieces that can be rotated. While irregular shape packing has been an active research area for many years, the work focuses on pack-ing a single strip for cutting material for manufacturing. However, while the problem at hand is quite different, we draw on the techniques arising from this research area in both geometry and algorithm design; see Bennell and Oliveira (2008, 2009) for reviews.

Our findings suggest that if the demand opportunity is such that the buyer should develop only one supplier, then he should invest in the supplier/tier with the higher portion of the supply chain margin. Conversely, if the opportunity is such that he should instead invest in both suppliers, then he should share a larger portion of the cost to improve quality with the supplier/tier with the lower portion of the supply chain margin.

We calculate the optimal pollution tax; so governments can implement strategical and rational environmental policies to maximize the general welfare function that includes consumers, firms and the social cost of polluting. We suppose that cross border pollution exists: the countries involved in the reciprocal dumping export a part of their pollutants to another country, and the remaining emissions are assimilated in the producing country. In this case, governments implement a pollution tax to the companies in order to compensate for the damage caused by the pollution. The pollution quantities the companies yield in each country are distributed in direct proportion to the quantities produced of the good for local consumption and the export market. From the results of the model we can mention the following: 1) if the marginal cost of polluting is high or if imports are very high, a positive tax is imposed, and 2) if the marginal cost of reducing pollution is greater than the marginal cost to pollute, then companies do not reduce their emissions.", :title "Cross border pollution and taxes", :keyword2 25, :authors (11509), :session 807}, 66 {:keyword1 10, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In many applications there is the need to represent graphs that are globally sparse but contain dense subgraphs.

Interactions between criteria can be taken into account.

This way, the leader raises electricity prices in Italy and increases its profit by 2.15% vis-à-vis QP-BC.

Particularly, ridesharing creates more benefits when the participation is high, and when the origins and the destinations of the trips are more spatially concentrated. The results show that ridesharing can create up to 31.3% mileage savings and up to 28.7% reduction in the number of cars needed to fulfill employees' travel schedules.

Currently formed intuitively, the routes for the vehicles rented for the pick-up process are not sufficient both in terms of cost and time elapsed to form the routes.

Upon introducing current inventory levels, demand forecasts and vehicle capacities; the program calculates the raw material requirements, optimal vehicle routes and minimum number of vehicles needed for the pick-up process. The objective of automatically finding optimal solution in a short time was achieved by lowering the current manual computing time of 1 hour to about 9 seconds.

The problem of computing the optimal plan for a pre-defined BAC is the fluence map optimisation problem (FMO).\r\n \r\nTo solve the FMO problem, an optimisation model must be defined.

Although appealing, the GS has, in our opinion, one main drawback: it still compressing all the criteria into one single value, usually using a weighted sum of all the criteria. \r\n\r\nIn this study we propose to extend the GS concept to a multi-objective GS which provides a set of efficient treatment plans decision makers can choose from.

The problem of controlling the stochastic growth of a pest population by the introduction of geometric catastrophes is studied. The damage done by the pests is represented by a cost and another cost is also incurred when the controlling action of introducing geometric catastrophes to the population is chosen. It is assumed that the catastrophe rate is constant. We aim to find a stationary policy which minimizes the long-run expected average cost per unit time. A semi-Markov decision formulation of the problem is given. It seems intuitively reasonable that the optimal policy is of control-limit type, i.e. it introduces geometric catastrophes if and only if the pest population is greater than or equal to a critical size. Although a rigorous proof of this assertion is difficult, a computational treatment of the problem is possible. Various Markov decision algorithms are implemented for the computation of the optimal policy. From a great number of numerical examples that we have tested, there is strong evidence that the optimal policy is of control-limit type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", :title "Optimal pest control through geometric catastrophes", :keyword2 177, :authors (49511 26039), :session 750}, 304 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This paper provides axiomatic characterizations of a concept of core for games in effectiveness form (Rosenthal, 1972) that unifies a wide variety of solution concepts prominent in the literature on social choice theory and game theory.

To avoid this issue, our aim is to design an a-priori routing plan that permits smalls changes in the inputs during its execution, i.e. a robust solution. To this end, we use a mean-average formulation for the capacitated DSVRP, which is based on a bi-criterion objective function to trade-off robustness (immunization) and performance (total cost). Contrary to the min-max objective in robust optimization, which computes a single feasible solution for the worst-case scenario, the mean-variance allows to compute different solutions for different degrees of robustness. Based on the formulation we propose a robust method which gives the decision-maker flexibility in choosing between the trade-offs, delivering solutions that can be less/more robust.

This methodology also implies that forecast errors are Gaussian iid. However, demand data is very complex and assuming that there exists a perfect forecasting model able to capture the demand pattern of each SKU is unrealistic. In fact, if iid assumptions are not fulfilled, several works have reported a significant deterioration of the supply chain performance. As an alternative to the theoretical approaches, empirical methods that circumvent the traditional iid assumptions can also be employed.

We argue that Maturana’s phenomenological onto-epistemology (we are immersed in the praxis of living in an ontological multi-universe) resonates with SSM tenets making feasible to combine and graft some of Maturana’s ideas (structural determinism/structural coupling and organisational closure) into some of the phases of the Checkland’s well-known SSM seven-step process.\r\nCheckland and Maturana’s work aim to understand and to improve problematic situations in organisations and in our everyday life; the proposed combined framework when adopted can have substantial implications to overcome SSM limitations.

One of the most fundamental issues with carbon offsetting is additionality, i.e., whether the project would have happened even if it were not financed through carbon offset market. One way for providers in carbon markets to ensure additionality of their projects is through the choice of delivery terms, specifically through \"forward crediting of ex-ante offsets.\" Alternatively, providers can choose \"prompt delivery of existing offsets\" as their delivery terms and ensure risk-free deliveries.  We analyze the competition between offset providers and identify their equilibrium choice of delivery terms.

PERT is an attractive technique that is used a lot in practice as it requires specification of few characteristics of the activities' duration. Moreover, its computational burden is practically nonexistent. Over the years, four main disadvantages of PERT have been voiced. In this paper, we propose an alternative technique for modeling the distribution of activity lengths that addresses three of these disadvantages: use of the beta distribution, restricting the analysis to three different scenarios for the whole project and PERT's optimistic expected project length. In particular, we alleviate the assumption on distribution and only assume the distribution of the activity duration to be partially specified as is common in Distributionally Robust Optimization. By only requiring specific characteristics of the activities' duration we retain one of PERT’s major advantages. The worst and best possible distributions that satisfy these characteristics can be specified exactly. We additionally develop an algorithm such that the expected project duration for these distributions can be calculated for realistic instances up to 100 activities.

For this reason, when measuring the fragility of any transportation network, it is necessary to develop a model in which there is an intelligent attacker who wants to harm the infrastructure. The purpose of this work is to establish a bilevel mathematical programming model to identify the most vulnerable components (stations/stops or connections) in a transportation network. In this model, the leader of the so-called Stackelberg game is the intelligent virtual attacker who wants to cause the most disruption in the transportation network by minimizing the amount of the flow on the network. The follower is the system operator who is trying to rearrange the transportation network so that the maximum amount of flow on the network is attained given the leader’s interdiction decisions.

To avoid this imitation, the distressed firm can discount the sales price to a high-value firm and delay the sales timing to a low-value firm.

Recent contributions model the shelf settings already more realistically by applying several different shelf segments instead of a one-dimensional shelf size. In these extensions, each segment can have its individual size regarding height, length and depth. However, these models assume given shelf size and do not model the interdependence of product allocation and shelf segment sizes. For example, the height of one segment may be reduced if there only small products are allocated or products are not stacked. We develop a new model that integrates the shelf size dimensioning into the shelf space allocation. It determines jointly (instead of separately as in current literature) the number of facings for each product, the shelf quantity and the size and number of shelf segments. At the same time, we consider several restrictions of the shelf structure (e.g. technical possibilities of the shelf system) and allocation rules (e.g. minimum and maximum number of facings, merchandising rules given by the retailer). As such, retailers get both, a profit-oriented optimization of the number of facings for each product and a detailed solution how the corresponding shelves must look like.

In this work we propose to integrate aggregation operators into the ELECTRE multi-criteria decision aiding method. ELECTRE technique employs the weighted average operator (WA) to compute the overall concordance index when constructing the outranking relation. The WA operator can be observed to have a sometimes an undesired compensative effect, so we propose substituting WA for three operators from the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) family of operators to give more flexibility to the definition of concordance as “a sufficient majority in favor of the outranking relation”. In particular, we study these 3 operators: OWAWA (Ordered Weighted Average Weighted Average), WOWA (Weighted Ordered Weighted Average), IOWA (Induced Ordered Weighted Average). They are appropriate because they are designed to combine the advantages of the WA operator and OWA operator. That is, they retain the importance given to each criterion while adding also a conjunctive/disjunctive character to the definition of majority.

While typically stochastic optimization is the approach, here we address the case where no distribution is given or can be deduced, which is the case when there aren’t any or enough or reliable or on-time past demand data or it cannot be attributed to a known distribution thus, we utilize Robust Optimization.

In this problem, the search operation is completed by the target capture by the interdictor following the target detection. It takes some time for the interdictor to capture the detected target after its detection. In the game, the searcher determines an allocation of search efforts in the search space and a standby position of the interdictor although the pre-planned interdictor's position is known to the target. The target chooses a path among its feasible options. If the target takes a mixed strategy of randomizing its path, the problem is defined as a two-person zero-sum game with the expected capture probability of the target as payoff. The searcher wants to maximize the payoff, but the target desires to minimize it. \r\nWe prove that there exists an equilibrium point with the searcher's pure strategy and the target's mixed strategy.

One example for this would be the practice of Philips. The problem with this practice is that it is difficult to motivate the retailer to reduce the returns. Both in practice and in theory different coordination mechanisms have already been tested and analyzed to achieve that goal, e.g. a limit on the maximum number of products which can be returned, or a rebate on the wholesale price whenever the retailer returns less than a target number of products. While these approaches target the volume of returns, they do not consider the subsequent disposition of the actual returns. As these products are typically lightly used (if at all), their residual value could justify remarketing on a secondary market. In this paper we consider this option by modeling an online store through which the manufacturer can sell the refurbished consumer returns. We study how the potential competition between these refurbished products and the new products affects the retailer’s behavior. Our main finding is that the retailer never exerts more effort when faced with the competition through the online store.

If staff shortage occurs, a substitution for all affected shifts has to be scheduled. To prevent unpleasant short-term changes, rescheduling aims at generating a new feasible schedule with minimum changes compared to the original schedule. Due to the large number of constraints and additional limitations based on previous shift assignments, this is a challenging task.  Our main objective is the development of rescheduling strategies in order to evaluate their functionality and practicability within a simulation study before implementing them in a real-world setting. The strategies aim at fairness among the regular nurses concerning individual satisfaction scores and extra hours balance. In addition, costs arising from the use of temporary staff are minimised.

We present an optimization model for delay management in railway networks that accounts for capacity constraints on the number of passengers that a train can effectively carry. While limited capacities of tracks and stations have been considered in delay management models, passenger train capacity has been neglected in the literature so far, implicitly assuming an infinite train capacity. However, even in open systems where no seat reservation is required and passengers may stand during the journey if all seats are occupied, physical space is naturally limited and the number of standing seats constrained for passenger safety reasons. Our model allows the rerouting of passengers missing their connection due to delays or capacity constraints which means instead of waiting one cycle time passengers may reach their destination on alternative trains and routes.

Different solution approaches have been derived for the BAP, all of which assume that the processing times of workpieces are known at each stage.

This paper is the first to take ride details and driver locations into account, and assuming that drivers and customers maximize utility, studying the optimal pricing strategy for ride-sourcing platforms. We consider two popular types of matching: the platform selects either the first driver to respond or the one closest to the customer. Under selection of the first driver to respond, we find that the platform price consists of a ride length based fare (set relative to the competing regular taxi fare) and a rush hour congestion fee, and increases with the customer waiting cost. Furthermore, the platform price if low relative to the regular taxi fare if traffic conditions are good, drivers have low profit expectations, and the platform commission is low.

In order to predict the student drop-out (subscription plan cancellation), 6 groups of features have been constructed to capture the student’s learning activities, i.e. student’s information, learning motivation, learning difficulty, student interaction, goal orientation and student cluster. Moreover, a benchmarking section between standard statistical models  and the most recent Logit Leaf Model (LLM) has been implemented to select the best accuracy model. Finally, insights into the impact of each feature group on the student drop-out is given as a suggestion for student retention strategy for this online learning platform.", :title "The beneficial effect of ensemble learning in predicting student drop-out in online learning environment", :keyword2 169, :authors (57333 31536 35404 54018 57769), :session 506}, 837 {:keyword1 76, :keyword3 7, :abstract "Due to the increase in the number of wireless devices with network access, the mobile video traffic will reach 82% of the overall Internet traffic by 2021.

This problem deals with two interrelated problems, a scheduling problem (RCPSP) and a routing problem (Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery - VRPPD), and belongs to the family of integrated problems. The RCPSPR is solved by Lacomme et al. in 2017 using a resource flow, inspired by Artigues et al. in 2003. The definition of a resource flow permits to identify the transportation operations, and to obtain a solution of the RCPSPR with an evaluation function. In the resource flow proposed by Lacomme et al. in 2017, modelled by a graph flow, the unit-capacity vehicles are not allowed to transport an amount of resource exceeding the demand of the destination activity. A new graph flow is proposed in this paper, in order to extend the routing problem, by allowing the vehicles to transport an amount of resource exceeding the demand of the destination activity with multiple-capacity vehicles. The extra resources transported can either be delivered and stored on the activity or kept in the vehicle to be delivered in another activity. This new model is evaluated with numerical experimentations, based on a mixed integer linear programming solved with CPLEX.

The aim of uplift modelling is to predict people's reaction to a campaign offering incentives towards taking a particular action, such as buying a product or not churning from a service. In the literature, it has been reported that uplift models can be unstable performance-wise (in terms of the Qini measure for example) and may consequently be deemed unreliable. We investigate whether model stability can be improved by modifying the class ratio using data sampling techniques, without worsening the performance in the process. Specifically, we use both under- and oversampling, as well as the methods smote and rose. Whereas the first two remove or duplicate records, the latter two artificially generate new records taking account of their neighbourhood while potentially also removing records. The uplift models are built considering uplift random forests, and the methods of Lo and Generalized Lai. In our experimental design, we take account of different class ratios and we use a number of direct marketing datasets. Furthermore, we check whether these new models show an increased performance, studying whether there exists a trade-off between stability and performance.

We formulate this as the competitive pickup and delivery orienteering problem (C-PDOP), in which both operators maximize their individual profit taking the actions of the competitor into consideration.

We prove that the C-PDOP possesses pure-strategy Nash equilibria and provide an iterated best response algorithm (IBR) to find these. The IBR requires at most four calculations of the (NP-hard) PDOP. Playing the Nash equilibrium, operators are never worse off than by ignoring competition.

Though a multimodel is an interpretable generalization of a single model case, it can contain large number of similar models. This leads to a low forecast quality and lack of interpretability.

The method is based on introduced similarity function for posterior distributions of models' parameters. Properties of this function are considered and asymptotic distribution of its values for coincident generalized linear models is obtained. The notion of an adequate multimodel is introduced, for which all the constituting models are pairwise statistically distinguishable.

More specifically, deciding upon the matches to be played in each round of a double round robin (DRR) tournament is known to be of great practical importance in scheduling soccer competitions. A popular approach to do so is the first-break-then-schedule approach. In such a hierarchical approach, a first decision concerns the Home-Away Patterns (HAPs) to be used by the teams, and a second decision concerns the scheduling problem: which match to be played in which round. Clearly, the latter decision crucially depends on the HAP-set that is chosen in the first phase – indeed, two teams whose patterns dictate they both play home in a particular round, cannot meet in that round. \r\nIn particular, it is conceivable that in the scheduling phase, a constraint is revealed that is incompatible with the given HAP-set. This would need to be solved by either changing the HAP-set, or by putting energy into mitigating the effects of violating that specific constraint.\r\nThe theme of this note is that not all HAP-sets are created equal. Indeed, different HAP-sets have different chances of leading to incompatible constraints.

Moreover, the exact values of migrants are seldom known due to data recording and collection errors; thus, there is a significant amount of vagueness and uncertainty in migration data.

The ellipsoid height is the height component of the 3D geographical location information for GNSS measurements. Orthometric heights are used in engineering applications due to physical and geometric reasons. The difference between ellipsoidal (h) and orthometric height (H) is equal to geoid height (N). Therefore, geoid determination studies are so important for finding H from the GNSS measurements. The orthometric heights are usually determined by the levelling measurements. The process of levelling measurements is laborious, time-consuming and costly. Henceforth, determining the optimum GNSS/Levelling geoid by reducing the field study is practical in terms of achieving the result as well as important in terms of reducing the project costs. In this study, an approach that reduces the GNSS/Levelling geoid model points to acceptable accuracy ratio by binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been proposed.

Among the methods developed to address this matter, PROMETHEE II (P-II) has earned some attention during the past decades. Given some parameters provided by a decision maker (DM) such as the criteria weights, P-II returns a complete ranking from a set of alternatives. In order to assess the stability of the ranking, weight stability intervals (WSI) have been developed. However, the WSI only considers one criterion at once (changes are assumed to be applied uniformly to the other criteria to keep the normalization). In this work, we propose to allow any modifications on any weight, by applying an inverse optimization (IO) based on mixed integer linear programming. The problem can be formulated as follows: what would be the minimum modification on the weights such that a given alternative of rank n > 1 becomes first? Applied to two case studies, this methodology, when compared to the WSI, shows that it is always possible to find narrower intervals while the simultaneous modification of all the weights is never required. Additionally, when using the WSI, it is observed that only few alternatives can be ranked first. However, by taking the IO point of view, all (non-dominated) alternatives can still be placed at the first position (though at the price of large deviations).

The leader of the game tries to maximize its influence spread by selecting a subset of nodes with given cardinality, in the existence of a rational follower whose aim is to minimize the spread by deactivating some of these nodes. The deactivated nodes cannot affect their neighbors, nor they can be affected. After the players make their decisions, the diffusion propagates according to Linear Threshold (LT) diffusion model, where the nodes have uncertain thresholds.

The rationale behind this evaluation is to allow the creation of multiple child nodes, and quickly evaluate which ones may be immediately discarded. The second evaluation is made globally over all the child nodes from each level. The goal of this evaluation is to perform a drastic prune on the branches that will potentially lead to bad solutions at the end of the algorithm.

We analyse the effect of including or not the environmental variables within the DEA models. For inefficient orchards, targets for raspberry production and GHG emissions are determined using both methods.

Then, a multi-objective optimization model of job shop scheduling which considers the makespan, the stability and the total completion time is set up. A two-stage optimization method is developed to get the Pareto optimization frontier. An extensive simulation-based analysis of the performance of the proposed method has been conducted. The simulation results show that our method can increase the stability of the scheduling significantly while keeping the performance of the scheduling on an acceptable level.", :title "Multi-objective optimization of job shop scheduling with risk of stablity", :keyword2 63, :authors (49806), :session 527}, 1098 {:keyword1 148, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We discuss and solve multiple problems with relation to path inconsistency. Multiple branch-and-price approaches were tested as well as two set partitioning formulations.

The exact procedure was enhanced with different concepts that were proposed in the literature for similar problems and common heuristic strategies.\r\nIn addition to the exact procedure, we discuss the existing modelling concepts for path inconsistency with respect to their applicability in real world scenarios. We analyze their advantages and drawbacks in certain real-world scenarios.\r\nWe tested the framework on capacitated vehicle routing instances, Solomon instances, and instances for the k-dissimilar and the m-peripatetic routing problem. The results show the impact of different enhancement methods to the solution time and the solution characteristics of different modelling concepts. The run times can be reduced easily by more than 75 percent with small changes to the classical labelling procedures. Even without cuts, we are able to solve a solid proportion of the classical as well as the problem specific instances. The strength of our framework is in its ability to solve instances with multiple periods for different inconsistency problems.

These shortages may cause an initially valid roster to become infeasible. A reactive procedure which assigns unscheduled employees to cover the shortages may be adopted in order to repair the infeasibility. Although this method is frequently employed, it is often inefficient due to employee unavailability, disruptions regarding employees' personal lives and also high costs. This work investigates robust nurse rostering and addresses the following research question: is it possible to organize a robust nurse roster which is not only less susceptible to disruptions but also has a lower cost to repair the roster to feasibility when disruptions do occur? The proposed methodology is validated by way of an integer programming model and a three-step simulation method. First, an initial solution is generated considering different proactive strategies. Second, disruptions are randomly generated over the solutions. Finally, the infeasible solutions are repaired and the final costs are evaluated. Several strategies are investigated employing proactive, reactive and a combination of these two strategies. Computational results demonstrate that a trade-off between proactive and reactive strategies performs best, reducing overall final cost by the most significant margin.

By a large change, the time window of a customer is shifted to another part of the day, while by a small change, the time window is only shifted for a small number of time units. To determine good candidates for a large change in the time window, the customers are clustered. Next, the time windows of the customers within a cluster are tuned to each other.

In particular, drones have already been successfully applied in related industries including energy, agriculture, and emergency response.\r\nRecently, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD) has been introduced as a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem. In the case of the VRPD, a fleet of trucks, each truck equipped with a set of drones, is tasked with delivering parcels to customers. The objective is to find a feasible routing that minimizes the time required to complete the mission. The drones may be launched from and recovered by the truck at the depot or any customer location, and move at a velocity that might differ from the truck's speed. Furthermore, drones possess a limited flight endurance and carrying capacity.\r\nThe VRPD can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and, consequently, be solved by any standard MILP solver, e.g., Gurobi. Due to limited performance of the solvers in solving large-scale VRPD instances, we propose an algorithm based on the well-known Variable Neighborhood Search. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm as well as the MILP solver, we carried out extensive computational experiments.

The utility of policy is continuous, detail and dynamic, but existing eco-efficiency analysis only provides single static efficiency results.

Port authorities are concerned with avoiding congestion at their facilities and efficient equipment usage while carriers want to minimize time spent waiting for and receiving service at ports of call. In a case study with the Port of Virginia (USA), schedules are created using a mixed-integer linear program minimizing total cost for different stakeholders and coupled with a Monte-Carlo simulation to account for expected fluctuations in inputs. This process is repeated for several scenarios, representing disruptions due to market demand, extreme weather, accidents, and others. The results show potential for significant cost savings. Furthermore, resilience of each vessel terminal assignment to the various emergent and future conditions is evaluated.

A problem of interest is how to evaluate the efficiencies of a set of comparable such processes in the presence of both products and co-products. In particular, there has been an increasing interest in co-products that can be considered as playing a dual role as either outputs from or inputs to the process involved. Efficiency measurement in certain situations where both products and co-products are present, can be addressed using data envelopment analysis (DEA). For example, reclaimed asphalt coming from the resurfacing of highways in various districts, offers an opportunity to perform maintenance at a lower cost, when that reclaimed material serves as an input together with new or virgin materials. At the same time, there is an undesirable environmental impact when reclaimed asphalt (not reused) serves as an output. In the current paper we develop a DEA-based methodology to evaluate the efficiency of maintenance activities in the presence of both products and co-products. The problem concerns how to examine co-products that can have positive value, up to a certain point, but beyond this point there are disposal/environmental costs that must be considered.

On the one hand, past research found a positive impact of remanufacturing on product quality. On the other hand, remanufacturing was shown to be negatively affected by an industry's technology trajectory of quality improvements. Using a stylized model of endogenous product quality improvement and remanufacturing we find that the main driver of the contradicting results is the change in manufacturing costs caused by improving product quality. A strong increase in manufacturing costs due to product quality improvement may induce the firm to take up remanufacturing when introducing the new product. Conversely, a small impact of product quality improvement on manufacturing costs reverses this effect and may indeed lead the firm to cease remanufacturing when introducing the new product. We find that the latter outcome is never beneficial from an environmental point of view, while the former always is. With endogeneous product quality improving innovation we then characterize conditions where a remanufacturing manufacturer would take a different product quality improvement decision than a non-remanufacturing manufacturer. We observe that remanufacturing stifles (stimulates) product quality improvement when manufacturing cost of quality improved products are low (high).

The objective is to minimise the maximum regret for any scenario generated within an instance. Given a set of jobs, an instance refers to the generation of the intervals of processing times and weights for jobs, whilst a scenario stands for the realisation of the job processing times generated within the intervals. Four heuristic algorithms utilising the lower and upper bounds are proposed in this paper. We develop the first heuristic with a pessimistic sense by considering only the upper bound, whilst the second one takes the optimistic approach using only the lower bound. The interval length is taken into account in the third heuristic, and the fourth one considers the position of the midpoint in relation to the mean of the midpoint of other jobs.

The valuation of CBs can be formulated as an optimal stopping problem, due to the possibility of voluntary conversion prior to maturity.  We begin with the plain Laplace-Carson transform (LCT) approach that generates a complex solution with little prospect of further analysis.  To improve this solution, we introduce the notion of premium decomposition, which separates the target CB value into the associated European zero-coupon CB value, the NPV of the future coupon payment stream prior to maturity, and an early conversion premium.  By the LCT approach combined with this premium decomposition, we obtain a closed-form LCT solution for the CB value and a nonlinear functional equation for the LCT of an early conversion boundary.  They have much simpler expressions than the plain LCT solutions without using the premium decomposition.  By virtue of the simplicity, we can easily characterize asymptotic properties of the early conversion boundary close or at infinite time to expiry.

This network is dynamically constructed from the rescheduled timetable, based on which passengers make their route choices. The basic idea of the model is dynamically building an event-activity network by rescheduling the timetable until all passengers are assigned to trains and the minimal passenger perceived travel times are achieved.

Nowadays it is common to partition the optimization problem of a complex system into smaller subsystems, each with a subproblem, in part because it is too difficult to deal with the problem all-at-once. Such an approach is suitable for large organisations where each subsystem can have its own specialised design team. However, this requires a design process that facilitates collaboration, and decision making, in an environment where teams may exchange limited information about their own designs, and also where the design teams work at different rates, have different time schedules, and are normally not co-located. Each design team is also expected to satisfy multiple design criteria. The existence of dependencies, relationships or interactions between the subsystems thus makes it difficult to predict the behaviour of the entire system.

The output of the steel milling process are steel sheets of different sizes. These steel sheets are still very hot when leaving the mill. For quality reasons a slow cooling step is desirable. In practice, one way to achieve a decelerated cooling speed is to build compact stacks of steel sheets. The slow cooling of compact stacks eliminates hydrogen induced cracks in the steel.\r\nThe underlying optimization problem is to assign steel sheets to stacks and to position each sheet inside its stack in such a way as to build stacks with maximum compactness. The problem has a dynamic nature since steel sheets arrive sequentially. Also, geometric and physical aspects restrict the positioning of steel sheets.\r\nFirst, we present a MINLP formulation for the hot sheet stacking problem (HSSP) with a single stack. A linearization of the MINLP formulation can be solved to optimality for instances with up to 15 sheets using a standard MIP solver. Real world instances contain around 50 sheets per stack.

The arising disassembling, sorting and assembling processes are carried out in the hubs of the network, also known as classification yards. On the tactical planning level, train services are determined (train-scheduling problem) and on this base, the demand is routed through the network (demand-flow problem). In Europe, train scheduling decisions are taken a long time before reliable demand forecasting data is available. Thus, transport orders have to be assigned to fixed train services. The optimisation potential arises in routing the transport orders such that utilisation of train length is maximised and the number of used train services is minimised. One of the challenges is to meet the capacity restrictions for each classification yard. Therefore, we propose a model which determines the flow of transport units through the network and the selection of train services. The novelty of the model is the explicit consideration of the processes in classification yards with respect to scheduling and resource allocation. Compared to existing formulations, this leads to more realistic routing decisions as railcar interchanges are modelled precisely.

We examine the impact of commercializing the output waste as biomass on the procurement strategy and profitability of the processor. The processor can procure the input via quantity flexibility contracts from two suppliers, a local supplier with lower exercise cost and a far-away supplier with a lower reservation cost, in advance of the selling season and from the spot market on the day. After commercialization, the processor sells the biomass, that would otherwise go to the landfill, to a contracted buyer. We find that the optimal procurement strategy switches from single sourcing to dual sourcing in a certain region of contract parameters after commercialization. We also find that as the correlation between input and output spot prices increases, (i) the total reserved contract volumes increase, (ii) the local supplier gets increasingly preferable and (iii) the profit improvement from biomass commercialization decreases. Using a calibration based on the palm industry, we show that failing to update the procurement strategy after commercialization leads to a significant profit loss. Using a framework for assessing the greenhouse gas emissions along the supply chain, we show that the commercialization of biomass can do more harm to the environment due to the change of procurement strategy.

Designing healthier diets is a complex process which can have substantial public health benefits.

Moreover, the current dietary preferences of individuals should be also considered to increase acceptability. Diet models have been developed and used for designing such healthier and acceptable diets. The main objective of these models is to determine the optimal quantities of available food items that should be included in a diet to optimize a specific objective function (e.g. maximize a dietary quality index). Additional constraints are defined to improve the acceptability of the calculated diets. These constraints are either in the form of upper and lower limits to the intake of specific food-items or in the form of fixed combinations of food-items in meals. Defining such constraints is challenging and involves expert knowledge and a substantial degree of arbitrariness.

An optimization model determines the optimal smoothing policy, its parameter and the service times such that networkwide costs of holding work in process, safety stocks, and of using overtime are minimized. Our analysis suggests that the ES policy is optimal for all cases when the outgoing service time minus the incoming service time at a stage is less than or equal to 1, while the EWMA policy is optimal for stages that do not hold safety stocks.

Classifying healthcare service utilization temporal patterns following transport injury may provide more detailed knowledge of the patient health trajectory, allow improved health system resource planning, and provide a starting point against which any future system level interventions can be evaluated. The purpose of this research is to identify groups of patients with similar patterns of service utilization, describe the characteristic of those groups and identify, in each group, the “typical” behavior of individual patients with respect to service utilization. To do so, we have proposed an analytical framework that utilizes latent variables to describe the utilization patterns over time and group time series into clusters. In order to group the patients’ behaviors in terms of service utilization over time, we have used a well-established statistical approach known as Mixture of Hidden Markov Models (MHMM). We tested our model with data from one of the main insurer of third-party personal liability for road accidents in Australia and found that three clear clusters of service utilization patterns are present in the data.

Traditional models of the economics of search suggest that as information acquisition costs associated with searching for products and services online are greatly reduced because of the Internet, consumers should search more extensively in online contexts. Recent empirical research strongly contradicts this hypothesis. We provide an alternate explanation by situating the problem of limited search within an economy of attention. Informed by a behavioural decision theoretic approach, we develop an empirical framework for consumer attention based on the size of the consideration set, market concentration of attention and search time. We conduct a natural experiment using a commercial panel of online clickstream data from seven major consumer markets representative of search activity from one-million consumers. Our results show that a parsimonious consumer search process can be explained by accounting for the attentional limitations of online searchers. Consumers face an attention allocation problem characterised by a trade-off between the number of alternatives searched for and the time spent searching for information on individual alternatives. Furthermore, we find that the competitive context of online markets effects both the magnitude and strength of this relationship. We discuss practical and managerial implications of our findings.

Consumers are likely to regret purchasing random products, because less desirable alternative might be obtained due to the hidden features at the time of purchase, and return is prohibited by the “no return” policy after purchase. When consumers can anticipate this potential post-purchase regret, the attractiveness of random products is lowered, which, intuitively, challenges the merits of probabilistic selling strategy. However, we show that, rather than being a curse, the anticipated regret is actually a blessing to the random product provider. We identify a new mechanism associated with anticipated regret and probabilistic selling, reverse quality discrimination, in which the anticipated regret deteriorates the perceived quality of the random product to a greater extent for higher taste consumers. By increasing the product differentiation, this effect may soften competition or soften cannibalization, making probabilistic selling more profitable and more likely to arise. \r\n", :title "Vertical probabilistic selling under competition: the role of consumer anticipated regret", :keyword2 173, :authors (57247), :session 471}, 1466 {:keyword1 45, :keyword3 96, :abstract "One of the key elements in hospitals are operating rooms, and one of the key decisions is which patients to select from the waiting list to be operated on, and the time to operate them.

However, when related to patients, goals focus on urgency or days in the list.  In this work we study the case where the surgeries of patients are not urgent.

As a consequence, the characterization of different inventory systems is one of the outstanding topics. The three key questions that inventory managers need to answer for designing inventory policies are: (i) how often should the inventory status be reviewed; (ii) when should a replenishment order be placed, and (iii) how large should be this order. However, once the policy has been selected, the main issue consists of dealing with uncertainties that are inherent in real environments. Uncertainty can be found, for instance, in how inventory costs are determined, usually treated as real and known whereas they include imprecise, or in knowing customer demand, which is usually treated by a probability distribution. Hence, the difficulty resides on the representation of this uncertainty in the model. Generally, inventory models overcome this drawback by using probability theory. Nevertheless, probability-based approaches may not be enough to reflect real inventory systems. This paper suggests new approaches to categorize inventory policies in which uncertainties are modelled using fuzzy set theory.

Lead time is one day.\r\nFor planning purposes in the supermarket, we search for order policies with fixed reorder days during the week, so we order at least 3 times a week, and at most every day. It is likely to have items of different ages in stock. Customers can pick the items in front of the shelf (FIFO), as preferred and stimulated by the store, or search for the freshest items (LIFO). The store has a target α-service level to meet demand.\r\nA Stochastic Programming (SP) model is presented of the situation in the retailer practice. Several policies to determine the order quantity are studied and compared to a policy from literature. The base is a YS order policy where the reorder days Y are fixed and order-up-to levels S are used, with parameter values generated by an MILP approximation of the SP model.

In a typical energy plant, electricity is generated by installing certain amount of photovoltaic (PV) panels with interconnections, inverters and battery units. The classical way of determining the amount of PV panels is through solar potential analysis of the region, analysis of the panel conversion factor, and the energy demand profile. Normally, the solar potential is evaluated and the radiation-to-electricity conversion factor is applied for determining the necessary number of PV panels for a given demand profile. In modern approaches, the ambient temperature is also considered to better model the conversion. In this study, it was observed that PV panels show an I/O lag with an input of solar radiation and an output of electricity. Typically, morning hours have lower energy yield than afternoon hours at the same solar radiation intensity, implying an overall hysteresis behavior. This is attributed to the temperature dependency of solar cells. Using actual solar radiation readings and real electricity conversion values from our experimental renewable energy plant in Anadolu University, the above effects are observed and mathematically modelled.

It is this calculation that requires so much computation time. Because of transfers, even seemingly small changes can have a large impact on the passengers’ routes.\r\nIn this research, local evaluation techniques are developed to decrease this computational burden. One of the core principles is that routes that are close to a change in the bus network are more likely to be impacted by a change. Closeness is defined as being reachable in a certain amount of transfers or in pure distance. Secondly, possible transfer points are very important. Passenger routes will only change when they transfer. The developed method tries to reduce the bus network considered during evaluation.

We show how the tree-walking rules in SUSPECT balance the need for lightweight computation with effective special structure detection. SUSPECT can be used as a standalone tool or as a Python library to be integrated in other tools or solvers. We highlight the easy extensibility of SUSPECT with several recent convexity detection tricks from the literature. We also report experimental results on the MINLPLib 2 dataset.

Operational decisions, regarding allocation, temporary distribution centres and lost markets, can be adjusted once the demand is observed. Accounting for these various flexibility mechanisms when designing the supply chain allows to deal with long-term changes in demand more effectively, and to obtain a more comprehensive uncertainty mitigation framework. We integrate these decisions in a location-inventory model formulated as a conic quadratic mixed-integer program, which can be efficiently solved using a commercial software. We derive managerial insights from a large set of experiments, analysing the usefulness of integrating various flexibility mechanisms in the design of robust supply chains. In particular, these flexibility mechanisms allow to decrease the overall cost by around 5%. In addition, they reveal interesting trade-offs.

However, this approach does not necessarily work well if parts are delivered at discrete points in time in bulk quantities.

As the SDDP is a sort of cutting-plane method, it can exhibit slow convergence when dealing with large-scale optimization problems. In order to accelerate the SDDP method, we modify its cuts in the forward step by employing some ideas related to the Chebyshev center of the SDDP subproblems' feasible sets. Essentially, the cuts are lifted by a parameter that vanishes along the iterative process without compromising convergence analysis.  Numerical assessments on the large-scale Brazilian LTHS problem with individualized decisions per plant, over a five-year planning horizon with monthly decisions, indicate that the new proposal significantly accelerates the SDDP method performance.

We conduct an experiment in full factorial design with explicit stochastic information feedback in two different representation forms. Results with respect to information representation indicate that if the individuals are presented with a representation format that fits to their characteristics, processing gets easier, leading to less bias.

The process is iterated heuristically in the generation of the augmented graphs. The essential arcs ensure that no-worse solutions would be yielded in each iteration. The heuristic approach for building augmented graphs supposes that it is possible to identify a meaningful group of arcs that might partake in the optimal solution.

Using an empirical description of the train energy consumption as a function of running times, the timetable design problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear optimization problem (MINLP) for a complete two-way line. In doing so, all the services in both directions along a certain planning horizon are considered while attending a known passengers' demand. The MINLP formulation, which depends on train loads, is fully linearised supposing train loads are fixed. A sequential Mixed Integer Linear (MILP) solving procedure is then used to solve the timetabling optimization problem with unknown train loads. The proposed methodology emphasizes the need of considering all the services running during the planning horizon when designing energy-efficient timetables, as consequence of the relationship among train speeds, frequency and fleet size of each line.

The portfolio selection under mean-LPM  framework becomes more complex when  proportional wealth is invested in risky assets as well as a risk free asset. This is because an investment frontier, which represents all linear combinations of a risk free asset and some arbitrary risky portfolio, is not always linear in the mean-LPM space. The linearity is obtained when the target is either risk free rate or mean return of overall investment portfolio. For other targets the linearity is not guaranteed. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we study the shapes and behaviours of the investment frontiers regardless of any targets.

It can be argued that water security risks to these communities arise predominantly due to failure to manage insurable risks that surround the water infrastructure. The impact of various common sources of risk, for example governance risk as well as endogenous risk are usually ignored or underestimated. Consequently, it would be prudent for financiers to make fewer unsecured investments and instead enable the communities to manage the exposures around existing water infrastructure through insurance.

First, an energy efficiency project often leads to changed consumption behavior; hence it is more difficult to evaluate the energy savings that are due to the project itself. The second challenge is that residential clients are more risk-averse and, thus, less willing to contract for projects whose outcomes are uncertain. Third, a lack of monitoring protocols leads to ESCO’s moral hazard problems. This paper studies ESCO contract design issues, focusing primarily on the residential market for energy efficiency. As opposed to other sectors, coordinating contracts do not exist. We show, however, that simple piecewise linear contracts work reasonably well.

Hydrogen can be used in internal combustion engines or fuel cells producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions when combusted with oxygen, once only water vapour is produced. In short, biodigesters today play an important role in generating energy and protecting the environment. On other hand, anaerobic biodigestion is a complex process and requires control of many factors for better efficiency in the conversion of organic matter into biogas. The objective of this work is to propose optimization techniques to determine optimal planning of biodigesters construction and operation, in which the total conversion of organic effluents to biogas occurs efficiently.", :title "Optimization of biogas production by anaerobic digestion", :keyword2 59, :authors (24012 14289 57970 57971), :session 433}, 1658 {:keyword1 69, :keyword3 101, :abstract "Shared value enhances the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously reducing societal burdens. By allowing companies to share their resources, collaborative logistics systems, so-called Physical Internet, provide companies with an opportunity to create shared value, namely, not only economic value by enhancing the utilization of resources, but also social value by reducing energy consumptions and greenhouse gas emission associated with logistics, production, and transportation. Emerging businesses such as ES3 and Flexe have recently demonstrated how they create shared value through collaborative logistics services, for example, ES3’s collaborative warehousing and direct-to-store program, and Flexe’s on-demand warehousing platform. However, the development of collaborative logistics systems is currently at a nascent stage. There are quite a few socio-technical barriers to overcome for sharing resources (data as well as infrastructure). This research, currently in progress, examines how companies create shared value from collaborative logistics systems. We highlight socio-technical barriers, particularly one set of social barriers, that is, competition-oriented conservatism prevalent among companies.

Thus, the goal is to find the optimal inventory policy that gives a major return on investment. The solution for the maximum profit per unit time does not necessarily match with the maximum profit/cost index solution. It is proved that maximizing the profit/cost index is equivalent to minimizing the inventory cost per unit item, instead of minimizing the inventory cost per unit time.

European regulators are increasingly requiring TSOs to improve the performance of their load forecasting techniques. In some countries (e.g., the UK), a dedicated incentive regulatory mechanism has even been implemented. TSOs have begun to heavily invest in the development of modern forecasting tools. They are reputed to have implemented advanced nonlinear forecasting techniques. Building on the seminal work of Forbes & Zampelli (2014), our approach to load forecasting begins by recognizing that the informational content of day-ahead prices. In case of efficient wholesale markets, it should thus be possible to model the quantity of natural gas demanded in a given day using two variables: the day-ahead price of natural gas (to model the reaction of both industrial users and households) and a spark ratio (i.e., the day-ahead price of electricity divided by the day-ahead price of natural gas) reflecting the economics of gas-based thermal generation. The ambition of this paper is two-fold as it: (i) shows that the estimation of a simple specification can be sufficient to challenge the performance of the TSOs’ forecasting models, and (ii) documents the short-run and long-run reaction of the daily consumption of natural gas to both the natural gas and electricity day-ahead prices by measuring the price elasticities.", :title "The economics of daily natural gas demand in France and in the UK", :keyword2 25, :authors (58020 20358), :session 718}, 1770 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 171, :abstract "We consider a dominant platform provider (PP) operating both legacy (A) and new (B) platforms, which connect users with suppliers in a two-sided market (TSM) context. In addition to the typical indirect network effects in TSM, backward compatibility (BC) works on B. Thus, users joining B can also enjoy the services provided by suppliers using A. Users and suppliers are linearly differentiated between two platforms as in the Hotelling model, and play a subscription game of choosing one platform at the lower level. The suppliers in B may suffer from congestion, which can be alleviated by PP's investment on B. PP also determines price margins for the supplier sides. Our equilibrium (eq.) analysis in the subscription game identifies an interior eq. (coexistence of both platforms in both sides). Though BC plays a stabilizing role for the interior eq., its stability is fragile due to the network effects. Rather, some boundary eq.'s, where at least one side tips to A or B, are more likely to be stable. BC is a key factor that characterizes the stable boundary eq.'s The upper stage game is led by PP, which tries to maneuver the system toward one of stable boundary eq.'s using price margins and investment. PP prefers all-B boundary eq. when the indirect network effect and the maximum price margin for B are large, and puts significant investment in B.

Order picking operations, the process of retrieving products from storage areas, is regarded as the most labor intensive, time consuming and as a result the most expensive operation in warehouses specifically with manual systems. Therefore, in order to manage a warehouse efficiently, the order picking operations must be robustly designed and optimally controlled.

Additionally, companies in the same geographic region may also compete for available water resources, which may even be diminishing at a steady rate. A possible solution to tackle these issues is to plan capacity expansions in view of water aspects such as availability, discharge limits, treatment capacity, available infrastructure, etc. We develop a mathematical modelling approach to plan capacity expansions in process industries, aiming to capture the interactions between strategic capacity planning and water management. We extend this approach to include other companies withdrawing water from a common set of resources for their daily operations. Using a game-theoretic approach, we study both competitive and collaborative behavior during capacity expansion and water use.

However, classical centrality measures have an intrinsic limitation: they evaluate each node’s importance merely on the basis of its individual contribution to the functioning of the network. Consequently, existing centrality measures need to be refined to take into account that the network nodes do not act merely as individual entities, but as members of groups of nodes. To this end, a possible approach consists in using methods and tools from Cooperative Game Theory.

However, this assumption has been validated only in more recent times using arrival data at major US airports.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present a dataset of inbound arrivals at 8 important European airports and show how to construct models of Poisson and Pre-scheduled random arrivals (PSRA) in a data-driven fashion.

We study a production queueing system considering quality of product that deteriorates as waiting time increases and it also depends on the service quality of the server, which degrades gradually as the accumulated service time increases. We define the framework of the corresponding queueing system of single stage and implement the cumulative negative quality(CNQ) measure. By utilizing absorbing time analysis, we estimate the final quality of the current product given the state of the system and we estimate the steady-state distribution of final quality and hence the yield of the end products. To estimate the yield of a two-stage system, we propose a bridging method to simplify the computation of absorbing time on a multiple dimensional state space into the computation on a series of 2-dimensional space that it can be extended to the multiple-stage system. For the application in practice, our model based results can be used to predict the final yield of a current semi-product and this will help us to determine whether further action should be done or to design proper settings of the production line in order to achieve the final quality goal.

The framework is used to look at the domain holistically, as the problem structuring methods literature has identified that interventions are not sequential, orderly, or linear in nature as well as having to take stakeholders, socio-political, and organizational routines and norms into account.

Traditional replacement policies for non-repairable products usually assume that the same product is available to replace the old one whenever it fails. However, due to the rapid development of science and technology, the lifecycle of a product is relatively shortened and the same product may not exist in the market shortly after it is introduced. Consider the case where there will be a new product released before the old one is phased out, and the new product is suitable to substitute the old one. In this case, before the new product is released, the product can only be replaced by the old one whenever the product fails. Similarly, after the old product is phased out, the product can only be replaced at failures by the new one. Between the time that the new product is released and the time that the old product is phased out, a failed product can be replaced either by the old one or switch over to the new product. Assume that the new product with a new purchasing cost and a new reliability function can compatibly substitute the old one.

This offers a completely new explanation for the price-setting behavior often observed in practice.

The model lets the planner specify the resource constraints (e.g., maximum available and minimum required resources at a location, resource work hours per shift, task type to resource type mapping, resource organizations [internal, contractor, mutual assistance], resource deployment policies [e.g., use contractor resources only if all internal resources are used], etc.).  It formulates the optimization problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), where stochastic scenarios are considered simultaneously to generate a single optimal resource positioning plan that achieves good restoration outcomes in any of the possible scenarios.

Many retailers have been integrating their network of brick-and-mortar stores with their online channel by fulfilling web-based orders from nearby stores instead of distribution centers (ship-from-store) and by offering their customers the option to buy online and pick up in store (BOPS). These omni-channel fulfillment strategies can improve profitability by moving store inventory faster, pooling inventory, and avoiding markdowns. Avoiding markdowns is typically preferred in the retail industry as higher margins drive higher profits. In this context, we study a centralized distribution system in a single-period newsvendor setting. The distribution system consists a retail store, a web-based store, and a distribution center. The web-based demand, received by the web-based store, is mainly satisfied through shipments from the distribution center.

Numerous labor regulations and other practical conditions enforce drivers to travel within the city network to designated bus stops to start/end duty, to take a break or to takeover a bus from another driver. This paper focuses on the driver scheduling problem with staff cars (DSPSC), where staff cars can be utilized by the drivers to fulfill their travel activities. However, staff cars should always be returned to the depot and can perform multiple round trips during the day. The problem is restricted by the number of cars available at the depot.

A comparison with a state-of-the-art mixed integer programming (MIP) solver indicates that the matheuristic provides better solutions for 6 out of 10 large instances.

Weights are a way of representing the relative importance of nutrient deviations. Almost all diet models employ a unit weighting scheme which, if rescaled, is equal to a uniform probability distribution. However, such distribution is unlikely to be universally optimal, given how greatly nutrient importance varies across different consumer subpopulations. Nevertheless, nutrition experts resort to it, since they do not know how to impose a different one in a structured manner.

Affective robots should not only provide better performance in assisting humans, but also might enhance robots’ abilities to make decisions. These approaches could enable an intelligent agent to adapt dynamically to users and its environment and potentially be used to enhance a wide range of applications. We describe several simulations performed with our model, showing its relevance and capacity to improve agent adaptivity.\r\n", :title "Affective decision making models  with applications to social robotics", :keyword2 164, :authors (58122 44685), :session 621}, 1982 {:keyword1 125, :keyword3 143, :abstract "Raw materials constitute the major cost in animal feed production.

Whenever such an unscheduled event occurs, a maintenance technician has to assess the defect and determine if the aircraft is able to safely perform the next flight. This process is known as the dispatch decision and depends on many variables. While the alternatives for aircraft dispatch are limited, the process of determining the appropriate corrective maintenance tasks and assessing the outcome for each decision alternative is a complex and time-consuming process. Currently, a maintenance technician on the platform has very limited access to relevant information and combined with the short time span available for decision making (i.e., 45 minutes in a typical turnaround), the result is often far from optimal with respect to operational performance.\r\nThis research proposes a novel Decision Support System framework for aircraft dispatch to aid the maintenance technician in decision making. The aim of the system is to increase operational performance by aggregating all required information, evaluate the alternatives and ultimately propose a ranked set of feasible dispatch alternatives to the technician.

Main restrictions on the system are the minimum and maximum capacities of the different parts of the pipeline network, the amount of carbon that can be sold to companies for utilization, and the capacities on the storage sites. Under these restrictions, the model aims to minimize the net present value of the sum of the costs associated with installation and operation of the carbon capture unit and the transportation of carbon, the storage cost in case of CCS, the cost (or revenue) that results from the emissions trading system, and finally the negative revenue of selling the carbon to other entities for utilization.

New tools for evaluating the polarization of a network are presented. We first characterize the homophily of each node individually. We depart from the definition of a new measure of the homophily of the nodes of a network and we consider the homophily distribution over the nodes as a primary indicator of the strength of polarization. Next, to address the polarization of the network as a whole, a probabilistic approach is developed. The approach is based on the straightforward computation of empirical cumulative distribution functions of sampled data from the network. These empirical distributions provide a more insightful understanding of the status of the network. They may be used not only to compare the polarization of groups of nodes or entire networks, but also to estimate the impacts of external interventions in terms of node polarization. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated on several case studies associated with real-life networks from different sources.

To capture the classical cost and responsiveness trade-off of transport services, a simultaneous usage of both transport modes in certain corridors is encouraged. \r\nWe extend the classical tailored base-surge policy (TBS) policy of dual sourcing literature to support firms’ modal split optimization. In TBS policies, firms receive a constant quantity from a distant but cheap supplier every period, and simultaneously, the firm can order from a nearby (fast) but expensive supplier. While TBS assumes that both supply modes have the same delivery frequency, in our modal split transport (MST) policy, we allow the slow transport mode to be used less frequently driven by a fixed cost occurring in rail transport.\r\nWe show that under an MST policy, the base stock policy for the fast mode is still optimal. A stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model is developed to obtain the base stock levels during a slow-mode cycle, i.e., the periods between two consecutive slow mode shipments.

Solving efficiently and rapidly HUCP, especially when considering the optimization of cascaded reservoirs, is particularly difficult. The main reason for this mostly arises from the need to model reality as accurately as possible. One particular way of dealing with this difficulty is by disposing of an a priori discretization, i.e., considering a specific set of operational points, typically chosen in order to have maximal efficiency (highest derivatives). \r\nIt is intuitive that a decomposition method is a valid strategy to tackle the hydro valley HUCP problem. However, it is also clear that the effectiveness of the method is subject to the efficiency of solving the obtained sub-problems. Our main postulate is that a two-reservoir single turbine hydro unit commitment problem (2RST-HUCP) is the essential building stone of these subproblems and can be handled efficiently.\r\nWe focus on the deterministic price-taker model with a two-reservoirs and potentially many discrete operational points for the underlying units. We extend a path formulation for the single reservoir hydro unit commitment problem presented in van Ackooij et al. (2018).

Most algorithms focus on finding the weight values that minimize the empirical loss given a NN structure provided as input to the minimization problem, that is nonlinear, nonconvex and high-dimensional. Common techniques to cope with efficiency (number of layers/depth, units/size, etc.) still rely on handling the NN structure as hyperparameter that is tuned using a validation set or on the dropout method which samples from exponential number of different thinned structures to reduce overfitting at the detriment of increasing training time. Instead, combining structure and weight learning yields a multi-objective minimization problem, where the NN structure itself becomes a variable of the problem (instead of a parameter). The proposed method for solving the combined problem extends the Generalized Benders (variable decomposition) technique to non-convex objective functions.

This is because the parallel sequential zone-picking lines are now connected into a zone-picking network. Also, orders no longer need to be divided into sub-orders in the revised system because orders are now allowed to travel anywhere.

This analysis, conducted with the optimization model TIAM-FR (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, a bottom-up, long-term and multiregional model), highlights the role of these elements in the future development of the BECCS option. \r\nMore precisely, based, on the one hand, on a specific methodology of biomass potential assessment, and, on the other hand, detailed data on storage potential, including onshore and offshore classification, this study aims to discuss whether such potentials may be a limit to the development of (bioenergy with) carbon capture and storage technologies. And at what extend. We thus investigate various scenarios with different levels of potentials and different climate targets on the long-term.

This is a novel strategy that does not require the use of the classical dualization scheme typically applied in robust optimization. The branch-price-and-cut method is based on a set partitioning formulation of the problem and relies on a robust resource constrained elementary shortest path problem to generate routes that are robust regarding both demands and travel times. Computational experiments using Solomons's instances show that the proposed approaches can obtain robust solutions within a reasonable running time, even when for large values of budgets of uncertainty and deviations.

Considering that many firms use flexible capacity (SS strategy) and dynamic pricing (DS strategy) together to tackle SDM, one of the recent works (Ceryan et al., 2013) studies the same. They find that under the presence of flexible capacity the difference between the optimal prices of the products (2 product setting) remain constant when both the products are critically understocked.

Product prices are often used as a signal mechanism by firms to differentiate two products (quality difference) in their product line.

Supplier audit information allows a manufacturer to have an updated assessment of the responsibility risk of the common supplier.

The amount of energy production oxygen demand is proportional to time and the share of fossil fuels in the generation profile of the country.

To identify the relevant similarities, sparse computation efficiently projects the data onto a low-dimensional space that is partitioned into grid blocks. A similarity is considered relevant, if the corresponding objects fall in the same or adjacent grid blocks. This guarantees that all pairs of objects that are within a specified L-infinity distance with respect to the low-dimensional space are identified as well as some pairs that are within twice this distance. For very large data sets, sparse computation can have high running time due to the enumeration of pairs of adjacent blocks.

This situation, common in public services, may also be associated with a supply chain environment, e.g., in the location of retail stores. For a supplier, an effective service is expressed by two competing goals: the facility location cost and the customer satisfaction. We assume that customer satisfaction is a matter of both fair allocation of transportation cost (system equity) and minimum total transportation cost (system efficiency).  Many different measures of system equity may be proposed, but we argue that equity is well captured by the minimization of the conditional mean of the transportation costs, i.e., the average unit transportation cost paid by a certain percentage of the total customer demand paying the highest costs. We embed the conditional mean in the Single Source Capacitated Facility Location Problem, obtaining a bi-objective MILP model, where the first objective is the total location cost, and the second objective is the conditional mean of the transportation cost.

Human resources tend to have different shape and top of their work efforts. This influence was formalized by a complex parametric mathematical model of Student Syndrome. Most commonly mentioned EVM lack is a declining credibility of Earned Value (EV) index while approaching the end of the project.

Also, costs in the phase of project tracking progress vary depending on the internal and external factors.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel value-at-risk (VaR) quantification method exploiting the time-evolving energy distribution of returns. Specifically, a time-scale decomposition is applied first on the returns series, followed by a nonlinear combination of the optimal subset of time resolutions for estimating VaR at a given trading horizon.

We apply a more high-level approach: to collect a portfolio of algorithms that solve the problem well and to learn when to use which algorithm while solving problem instances. This is called online algorithm selection. The core idea is to use a supervised learning method to create a regression model for each algorithm, predicting its performance. To do so, a set of descriptive features is required. For each new instance, the predicted best algorithm is selected. Its performance is then observed and used to further refine its regression model, resulting in better selections over time. An advantage of online algorithm selection is that no time must be spent on developing and fine-tuning new algorithms: it automatically learns to combine the algorithms already developed. Furthermore, new algorithms can be added to the portfolio, and the method can learn when to use them. Online algorithm selection is most useful for problems at the operational level, as those must be solved often (generating a lot of new performance data) and in a short time (if much time is available, all algorithms can simply be run in parallel).

We identify the network flow structure of the problem and derive properties of its optimal solution. Based on these, we decompose the problem and show that sub-problems can be solved in polynomial-time.

This leads to a significant amount of market adjustments from thermal power plant redispatch and renewable curtailment with rising expenditures, system inefficiencies, and carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, a multi-objective nonlinear optimal power flow approach of the congestion management, accounting for minimal deviation from the market result, as well as cost and emission caused by congestion management, has been developed. The results of the congestion management optimisation in a significantly congested system show that the multi-objective solution accounting for all dimensions has substantial advantages in comparison to the optimisation towards a single objective. An example of this is the minimisation of the deviation from the market result as it is performed in today’s congestion management regime in Germany.

That generalization introduced the concept of disjunctive conic cuts (DCCs) and disjunctive cylindrical cuts (DCyCs).

The picking facility in manual order picking systems usually has a limited capacity, and picking of the ordered items is a time-consuming operation especially when a high number of different items are ordered. The order batching problem (OBP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that is encountered in order picking process.

Moreover, one drawback of Markov disease spread models is the exponential disease duration assumption which is not realistic. Therefore, we extend our study by assuming gamma distributed disease duration and recalculating the important properties explicitly.

When BNs are constructed based on expert judgement, the main difficulty concerns the quantification of the portrayed cause-effect relationships in conditional probability tables (CPTs). The number of probabilities to be given for a single CPT can rise up to hundreds or thousands. Assessing so many probabilities coherently and without biases may be an overwhelming problem for the expert due to cognitive burden or lack of time.

Although oblique cuts, with at least two variables, have also been proposed, they involve cumbersome algorithms to identify each cut of the tree. The latest advances in Optimization techniques have motivated further research on procedures to build optimal classification trees, with either orthogonal or oblique cuts.

Although the results of such optimal classification trees are encouraging, the use of integer decision variables leads to hard optimization problems.

The existing legislative framework poses several challenges, stemming (mainly) from a highly non-homogeneous and spatially differentiated system, with cases where the penalty fines are as low as the benefit that the violator enjoyed from not complying. This paper presents the status quo of enforcement in different countries, where the regulation applies, and develops a game theoretic approach for a uniform violation fine system. A mixed strategy game with two players is proposed, representing the ship operator (who can choose to comply or not comply to the regulation), and an enforcement agency (that can opt to inspect or not inspect the ship) respectively. The equilibrium results in an improved penalty system (for both violators and enforcing agencies). Such a system can ensure a level playing field for ship operators that currently have invested heavily in an abatement of options to comply with the sulphur regulations, by promoting good practices among ship operators, while at the same time improve compliance rates and maximize societal environmental benefits.

We show that several centrality measures (CM) (degree, eigenvalue centrality; Katz-Bonacich centrality; diffusion centrality; alpha centrality) do characterize not just separate nodes but types of nodes. Networks of different size but the same typology have common properties in economic models,; in particular, game equilibria may be transplanted among them.  The concept of typology is based on the fact that the nodes in any undirected graph may be colored in a minimal number of colors in such way that each node of a color is characterized by numbers of neighbors of different colors. A typology is described by a matrix T, which for any type shows numbers of neighbors of different types. For any typology, if i an j are nodes of the same type (may be even belonging different networks of the same typology), then с(i)=c(j), where c is any of the abovementioned CM. For calculation of these CM, the matrix T may be used instead of the adjacency matrix. Bloch et al., 2017 formulate a problem: for which classes of networks each of a set of several CM defines the same order on the set of nodes of network? As such a class of networks, they find a class of trees – regular monotonous hierarchies.

Under these circumstances, certain users are worse off when compared with the UE, however it minimises the total travel time. A common measure for how much a network deviates from SO is to compare UE with SO; this is done using the price of anarchy (PoA) (Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou 1999), the ratio UE/SO.

In a static day-ahead context, our dedicated metaheuristic generates solutions that allow to take advantage of the specific characterisitics of each of these transport modes.

This daily plan is usually repeated each day of the week (with modifications during weekends or holidays). If the plan is repeated cyclically, then at every station the stored units at the end of the day need to match the required units at the beginning of the following day. Because of disruptions in the daily operations, planned maintenance in the network or others reasons, the timetables can deviate from what was originally planned therefore the balancing condition may be violated and there can be a number of off-balanced stations (with a surplus or a deficit of units). To rebalance the rolling stock in the network new deadhead trips, trips that run empty (starting from a surplus station A to a final station B where there is a deficit of those units), have to be scheduled in between the passenger trains by the railway operators.

More precisely, we propose and test several variants of a Progressive Hedging (PH)-based heuristic approach as well as a more classical Benders algorithm. The results obtained on benchmark instances show how the proposed methods outperform the existing ones and the state-of-the-art solvers in terms of efficiency and solution quality.

Due to the increasing number of containers handled by terminals, the arising uncertainties, such as traffic conditions, inaccurate container information and vehicle availability, can significantly influence terminals’ efficiency. This work proposes the integration of vehicle scheduling and container storage allocation with the consideration of a variety of risk scenarios during unloading process in a straddle carrier-based terminal, in which quay cranes (QCs) and straddle carries (SCs) are used to handle containers. The ship’s berth time is used to measure the efficiency of terminal operations and can be calculated by the time when all containers are unloaded from ships. Risk scenario in this work is represented by a number of uncertain factors, which affect the handling time of SCs for containers. The uncertain handling time of SCs is defined as fuzzy parameters with triangular membership functions. This problem is first modelled as a fuzzy optimisation model and then de-fuzzified into a crisp mixed integer programming model. Two types of decision making policies are investigated: (1) risk neutral policy, minimising the berth time with the consideration of all risk scenarios; and (2) risk averse policy, using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach to measure the worst-case scenario.

An efficient arrear management scheme is to target those who are more at risk of falling into long-term arrears so that interventions can avoid lost revenue. In our research, a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) based time series prediction model is implemented to differentiate the high-risk tenants from temporary ones. The model measures the arrear risk for each individual tenant and differentiates between short-term and long-term arrears risk. Furthermore it predicts the trajectory of arrears for each individual tenant. The arrears analysis investigates factors that provide assistance to tenants to trigger preventions before their debt becomes unmanageable. A five-years rent arrears dataset is used to train and evaluate the proposed model.

Hence, it is possible to decide on the variable processing time per activity and therefore, also on the starting time of every activity.

The recovery rate is the proportion of the outstanding balance at default that will be paid back by the creditor as part of the recovery or collections process.  However, relatively few studies have thus far appeared on credit card data and they did not yet consider the extent to which the explanatory variables in these models may be non-linearly related to the dependent variable.  We propose a generalised additive model to produce recovery rate estimates for credit card accounts in default.

Furthermore, the model is able to capture any non-linear relationships that may exist between those and the explanatory variables.

This task is achieved by connecting turbines with the usage of different kinds of cables. In the traditional version of the problem, turbines are connected through low voltage cables (the so-called inter-array cables) to an offshore collection point (called substation) and then through a high voltage cable (the export cable) the energy is moved to shore.

The objective is to satisfy the demands by minimizing the trees harvested. (The parts of the logs that do not fit in the demands are wasted). First of all, we classify this problem as a variant of Multiple Stock Size Cutting Stock Problem (MSSCSPs). In MSSCSPs some sets of stock of different sizes (such as the logs of the trees) must be cut following certain patterns. The main additional difficulty of the forestry problem lies in the fact that estimates of the stock sizes differ (sometimes significantly) from real stock sizes. This implies that the cutting patterns cannot be known a priori and that the amounts of products that will be obtained from cutting the stock are uncertain. We tackle this MSSCSP in a dynamic way by re-computing solutions: 1st computing the difference between expected and obtained amounts and 2nd updating the “targeted” amounts as the cutting process progresses.

The IT-VSP is formulated as a MILP that minimizes transfer costs with a budget on operational costs. Given an initial non-cyclical timetable, time-dependent service times and passenger demands, the transfer time cost is minimized by allowing modifications to the timetable that respect a set of headway constraints. Timetable modifications consist of shifts in departure time and addition of dwell time at intermediate stops.

The external source from which this money comes from or is sent to is not explicitly modelled but is assumed to be available at all times. In our work we seek to contribute to this problem by explicitly modelling this external source by the inclusion of a second asset. This asset will generate an income which we allow to be either deposited directly to the cash account or contributes to the asset account's volume. We model this version of the cash management problem, in which credits and debits from/to the cash balance are to/from the asset account and incur transaction costs for these movements, as a Markov decision process.

In railway systems that are characterized by intensive use of the railway infrastructure and strong interdependencies between rolling stock and crew schedules, such disruptions can propagate and accumulate. If no counter measures are taken, there is a risk that this leads to an out-of-control situation, where hardly any trains are running in the affected region, even though the required resources (infrastructure, rolling stock and crew) might be available. In this talk we propose a strategy to cope with these (near) out-of-control situations. The core idea of this strategy is to completely decouple the operations in the disrupted region from the rest of the railway network, with the aim to isolate the disruption. We propose to use a simplified line plan which allows for smooth operations without centralized scheduling.  We introduce a novel line planning algorithm, which is designed to generate line plans that can be operated in (near) out-of-control situation by partially integrating constraints inspired by timetabling and rolling stock scheduling.

Today, ships are ordered by MSC and CMA CGM to be completed in 2019 and 2020, which are estimated to carry at most 23,800 TEU: an increase of nearly 10,000 TEU in 10 years time. \r\nThis increase in container ship size does not only bring about potential economies of scale for liner shipping companies, it also puts pressure on ports. In order for ports to be able to accommodate larger container ships, sizable investments in infrastructure need to be made.

Thus, ports located in the same region need to compete for hub status, or specialize in other areas, for example in facilitating transshipments.\r\nIn this study, we investigate primarily how container ship growth affects port choice and port call size.

This possibility is almost not studied in the literature, although it is quite realistic. To model the situation, we study a problem of discrete choice under uncertainty. The key feature of our model is costly information acquisition by the decision maker (agent). The cost, as it is traditional in Rational Inattention literature, is modelled as a reduction in entropy. In our formulation of the model, the information is acquired from a firm's manager (principal); that is the manager, who delegates the decision to the agent, faces the costs. In this framework, we analyze the optimal initial information setup which the manager provides to an agent.

To do so, the macroscopic model is derived from an LP with an underlying network structure, while the microscopic model is based on a discrete event simulation. In this way, we propose an iterative process, in which the output from one model is the input of the other one: the movement of the evacuees through the network paths are simulated, resulting in new information about the transit times during the evacuation, which is used to execute the optimization model again. This process is iterated until the convergence of the optimization flows, producing a mesoscopic framework that considers bottlenecks, flows direction, pedestrian speed variations, and congestion.

Essentially, DDs represent a COP’s solution space comparable to a dynamic programming’s state graph. As the size of DDs grows in general exponentially with the problem size, relaxations of DDs are typically considered. Such relaxed DDs describe an overapproximation of the solution space, while being much smaller than the original DD. Hence, they represent discrete relaxations of the problem often yielding tight dual bounds. A prominent way to compile good relaxed DDs is by starting with a trivial relaxed DD and to perform incremental refinements. After each refinement, a better approximation of the set of feasible solutions is obtained. In previous approaches, the order of the applied refinements is predetermined. We consider a price-collecting sequencing problem for which such a predefined strategy is not applicable. We propose for this reason an incremental refinement algorithm that decides dynamically, based on the current best bound, what to refine next. The second part of our work is dedicated on deriving good primal solutions from a relaxed DD. It is based on the observation that the refinement removes many infeasible and in our case also suboptimal parts from the search space and provides a promising starting point for primal heuristics.

It simultaneously accounts for the quantity of goods, time of delivery, and delivery routes instead of solving the inventory and routing problems sequentially. This resembles the concept of vendor managed inventory and allows to reduce costs and shortages across supply chains. When optimizing such a supply chain, safety stocks have to be allocated across its different stages to meet the target end-item customer service levels. However, it is not obvious at which stages safety stocks need to be placed in order to meet the target service levels, at the same time minimizing overall supply chain costs. For this reason, we consider a multi-echelon inventory routing problem in which we address the problem of strategic safety stock allocation. We propose a mixed integer linear program with dynamic lot-sizing and safety stock planning and include the guaranteed service model for the underlying distribution system. We investigate the problem under non-stationary demands. Therefore, we also incorporate capacity constraints because it has been shown that they lead to solutions with lower overall holding costs in this context.

A flexible headway time model is tested on a part of the Dutch railway network and compared to an existing model with fixed minimum headways.

If the capability trust is built between the buyer and the supplier, then the optimal price contract will be concave, convex or linear w.r.t the supplier’s output, depending on both parities’ degrees of risk aversion. If goodwill trust exists between the buyer and the supplier, then the optimal price contract is always linear w.r.t the supplier’s output. If the buyer has capability trust toward the supplier but the supplier has goodwill trust toward the buyer, then the optimal price contract is always concave in the supplier’s output. In reverse order, then the optimal price contract is always convex in the supplier’s output.

When the tasks differ based on model, the line balance and sequence can interact to induce work overload in some stations. Assuming a line balance is fixed, the sequence can be adjusted to try to minimize work overload. One mechanism is to assume a utility worker can double the speed of the worker at the overload station. In contrast, in the skip policy, the utility worker takes over the work piece that is expected to cause the overload while the normal worker instead starts working on the next work piece.  Additionally, “swimming” allows the worker to move into adjacent stations, in effect, getting ahead or keeping up with incoming work.

The distirbution takes place by 2 different type of vehicles of different capacity. The company has 11 different parking lots with a different fleet. We adopt a solution framework that consists of two stages. The first stage involves the partitioning the stations into clusters, where the total cost of purchasing and delivery is computed by approximating the delivery part. In the second stage, an inventory routing problem is solved to find the detailed distribution plan. For both stages we formulate mixed-integer mathematical programming models, which are solved by Cplex 12.8. The solutions obtained are promising in the sense that the total cost given by the solution is lower than the cost incurred by the company.\r\n", :title "Optimization of the LPG distribution system for an oil company", :keyword2 150, :authors (58852 23883), :session 628}, 3244 {:keyword1 150, :keyword3 178, :abstract "Battery- powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used to enhance humanitarian response.

Therefore, an organisation considering whether to invest in cyberinsurance may weigh up the perceived probability and severity of suffering a cyberattack attack (and the associated consequences) against the perceived benefit of not investing in cyberinsurance, i.e., costs saved due to not paying for the insurance policy. When considering whether to purchase cyberinsurance, organisations will calculate the benefit-risk trade-off.

There are not only language issues, but also legal requirements and marketing strategies that make it necessary to have different labels for each market. Production planning in a winery refers mostly to the bottling stage of the wine supply chain. It generally assumes that the different types of wine produced by the winery are available in storage tanks. \r\n\r\nWineries may choose to use a make-to-stock or make-to-order production strategy. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. However they may also use a postponement strategy, by postponing labeling. The advantage is that it might be possible to postpone labeling until the order arrives, and the market to which the wine will be exported becomes known. This allows keeping an undifferentiated stock of bottled wines as opposed to keeping a stock of wines for each of the possible markets. \r\n\r\nIn this work we present a stochastic linear programming model and a robust optimization model to assess the benefits of using a postponement strategy for wine production planning.

Analytical expressions of the optimal investments levels, service prices and expected profits under specific assumptions of demand and cost functions are derived. We prove that coordination is attainable under our proposed model and both parties achieve a better pay-off.

To arouse managers’ interest in the implementation need of an adequate lattice of sensors across their water supply networks (WSNs), and to support them in the implementation, three important questions should be first answered that should be clearly perceived as main support elements in ad hoc decision-making: firstly, how many sensors are needed; secondly, where sensors should be located to get the most out of them; and, finally, what their measurements will bring in terms of improving operation and customer services. This contribution addresses the second of these questions without forgetting the other two. Because of the nature of the objectives involved, the decision about where to locate sensors in a WSN, even under a tight budgetary constraint on the number of them to be installed, is a very challenging problem.

Specifically, we consider a make-to-order system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process, and the production/service times are i.i.d. exponential random variables. This gives rise to an M/M/1 queuing model. Customers place a value on the service they receive and a cost per unit of time of delay. The risk aversion is modeled by a concave utility function of the net benefit. Based on this utility customers make individual decision to join the system or seek an alternative service with fixed value. Customers know the potential arrival rate and the economic parameters are common to all. They observe the actual state of the queue upon arrival.

Here we study the optimal growth problem, in continuous time and controlling for the rate of population growth. The involved exponential population growth at an endogenous and probably variable rate, transforms the standard optimal control problem with a constant rate of time preference, into another dynamic optimization problem where the Pontryagin's maximum principle cannot be directly applied. This is due to the “effective” non-constant discount rate, which makes preferences intertemporally dependent. In fact, depending on the degree of intergenerational altruism the discount rate depends on past and current rates of population growth.

Robustness is usually defined as the ability of a network to maintain its total throughput under node and link removal. We focus on spectral graph theory where robustness is measured by means of a graph invariant called Kirchhoff index, expressed in terms of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated to a graph. The Kirchhoff index (also known as effective graph resistance) can be alternatively defined as the accumulated effective resistance between all pairs of vertices. This index can be highly informative as a robustness measure, showing the ability of a network to continue performing well when it is subject to failure and/or attack. In fact, the pairwise effective resistance measures the vulnerability of a connection between a pair of vertices.

The resulting strategy held loss of sales to just 15% and - crucially - sacrificed little of the product's price and profitability. This episode illustrates an \"agile\" approach to building system dynamics models. Typical modeling starts with qualitative mapping of possible relationships to produce a causal diagram. Expert modelers then construct a matching software model structure, and seek data to produce a working model. Finally, the model is validated before being used to solve the problem. This process takes too long, costs too much, and is unreliable. Fundamental system dynamics principles suggest a simpler, faster and more reliable process, which moves immediately - less than 1 hour - from the performance of concern to a simple, yet quantified and working model of how changing asset-stocks are driving that performance. From there, interdependencies are traced - extending the working model. Validation is continual, through checking that the simulation matches reality.

Typically, agro-food industrial companies produce refined and standardized intermediates, which are mixed and further processed by the food assembly industry into final consumer products. These two stages in processing lead to potentially avoidable losses. A more integrated design of food processing chains avoids such losses, using for instance different intermediates, processing pathways, and supply chain configurations. For the design of such chains, the specific characteristics of food products, food processing, and food supply chains have to be taken into account, and decisions regarding the selection of intermediate and final products should be included. To deal with this design problem at the product, process, and chain level, both the fields of supply chain management and process systems engineering are required, bridging the gap between these fields. Using mixed integer programming, we show that using alternative intermediates and processing pathways leads to improved chain performance from both an economic and an environmental viewpoint. Which processing pathways are optimal is however dependent on the regional and seasonal supply chain characteristics.

As a consequence, many EDs globally are in a situation where the demand for ED care by far outstrips its supply―a phenomenon called Emergency Department (ED) crowding. Besides compromising overall ED performance, ED crowding can impair the quality of care delivered to patients and lead to longer patient waiting times. In Singapore, total ED attendance at public hospitals has grown significantly, that is, roughly 5.57 % per year between 2005 and 2016 and, as a consequence, emergency physicians (EPs) have to cope with patient volumes way above the optimal workload. The purpose of this study is to create a virtual world of a hospital-based ED in Singapore using system dynamics in order to visualize and improve patient flows within the ED. The virtual world integrates both the demand side (patient flows) and the supply side (EPs and nurses) of the ED. This allows identifying bottlenecks, i.e., ED venues where patients accumulate, that put a strain on ED performance. Based on the simulation model, we analyze how ED manpower needs to be adjusted in order to dissolve congestions and smooth ED patient flows.

As a consequence, policy-makers as well as managerial decision makers, who are often poorly trained in mathematical modeling and have restricted resources, refrain from using quantitative system dynamics and apply, if anything, qualitative system dynamics to their complex strategic problems. However, the sole application of qualitative system dynamics to complex strategic problems bears the risk of generating weakly validated and potentially misleading results. Therefore, in this study, we propose an intermediate phase in the system dynamics modeling process in order to fill the gap between qualitative and quantitative system dynamics.

The goal is to choose potential transplants in the first stage, so that the expected number of transplants in the second stage is maximized. To solve this problem, we make use of Monte Carlo simulation to generate scenarios, and optimize the number of transplants over these.

In most models customer demand is assumed to be discrete and aggregated to a relatively small number of points. However, in many urban applications the number of customers can be in the millions and representing every residence as a separate demand point is infeasible. Therefore it may be more accurate to represent demand as continuously distributed. Moreover, the demand region and the region in which a facility can be located are often assumed to be convex polygons. However this is not realistic for real world applications. While a non-convex demand region can be modelled as its convex hull with zero demand where appropriate, a non-convex feasibility region requires more work. Yet more problems occur when we introduce areas that cannot be traversed since we now must use geodesic distances.\r\n\r\nWe consider the market share problem where the locations of p facilities are fixed, and we seek the optimal location for an additional facility with the objective of maximising the total demand attracted by that facility; the function of which depends on the partition of the demand space into ‘Voronoi cells’.

Next, an attempt is made to find a feasible solution with UB-1 bins, and this process continues until reaching a lower bound or the time limit. In order to find a feasible solution with a given number of bins, m, we build a partial solution with m-2 bins and then transform it into a complete solution with m bins through applying a local search. The partial solution is one that contains a set of items assigned to m-2 bins, without any capacity violation, and a set of non-assigned items. The goal is, by rearranging the items, to obtain a configuration such that non-assigned items can be packed into 2 bins, thus producing a feasible solution with m bins.

Our results show that a combination of RPI and creativity-weighted pay increases employee creative productivity and prevents a “crowding-out effect”. The current study presents and tests a general model for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of RPI and creativity-weighted pay on the quality and quantity of employee creative productivity. Our findings implicate that RPI induces motivation, but we find that the effect regarding total productivity is magnified when the RPI is public rather than private. However, it is also shown that creativity-weighted pay interacts with the use of RPI and leads to a significant increase of both quantity and quality of creative productivity. By isolating the RPI and creativity-weighted pay effects, our study provides insights into the costs and benefits of RPI in a creative productivity environment.

Researchers have come up with different MILP models to find the optimal number of exchanges for these registries considering the bounds on cycle length. Finding bounded length cycles over a network is a NP hard problem and for large number of nodes these models can take exponential amount of time to solve for optimality. Thus we propose a heuristic solution which will allow us to solve the problem of kidney exchange in reasonable time. It is a data driven approach which uses the compatibility of blood groups and the idea of prioritizing crucial pairs to increases the number of transplants. All proposed transplants do not execute in practice due to various reasons, cross match positivity being one of them which shows that a recipient has become sensitized to a blood group profile. These sensitized recipients need to be incentivized as they are having higher chances of cross match positivity. Our algorithm prioritizes these sensitized recipients to increase the probability of successful execution of the proposed transplants.", :title "Heuristic solutions for kidney exchange program", :keyword2 18, :authors (53261 28300), :session 707}, 3691 {:keyword1 5, :keyword3 121, :abstract "Many problems in operations research require that constraints be specified in the model.

We focus on personnel rostering and scheduling problems in which there are often past schedules available and show that it is possible to automatically learn constraints from such data. To realize this, we adapted some techniques from the constraint programming community and we have extended them in order to cope with multi-dimensional data. The method uses a tensor representation of the data, which helps in capturing the dimensionality as well as the structure of the data, and applies tensor operations to find the constraints that are satisfied by the data. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used constraints from the Nurse Rostering Competition and generated solutions that satisfy these constraints; these solutions were then used as data to learn constraints.

It is necessary for ensuring a high service level, but extremely costly. In recent years, the question if and how users can be engaged for relocation has attracted much attention. \r\nWe address this question in a context of a free floating (stationless) bike sharing system. Free floating systems lead to complex spatio-temporal distribution patterns. We investigate some basic properties of the bike distribution under stochastic demand, and we study the relationship of number of bikes and service level under various demand and usage patterns. \r\nSetting incentives for dropping off bikes at, or picking up bikes from, specific locations changes the bike distribution and may increase the service level. We develop a general methodology for dynamical setting of incentives, based on the current bike distribution and a forecast of pick up and drop off distribution. The methodology can be applied to pick up as well as drop off incentives in various settings. Simulations studies show that, under optimum user incentivization, the number of bikes needed for achieving a service level of 95% can be reduced by about 30%, resulting in substantial cost reduction for the operator.  \r\nWe show how the methodology has been implemented in the new e-bike sharing system “smide” in Zurich, launched in 2016 by the insurance company Mobiliar. \r\n", :title "Setting incentives for user based relocation in free floating bike sharing systems", :keyword2 173, :authors (59301 59302 59303 59306), :session 770}, 3811 {:keyword1 72, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This study analyzes the soccer team’s playing styles in the 2014 FIFA World Cup based on gameplay data.

These problems embed a notion of proximity (or coverage radius) that specifies whether a given demand point can be served or ``covered'' by a potential facility location. One of the best known members of this family is the set covering problem location problem (SCLP) in which one must choose a minimum cost set of facilities so that every demand point is covered at least once. The drawback of the SCLP is that it often leads to costly or unrealistic solutions because it gives the same importance to every demand point, regardless of its position and size. To overcome this weakness, two main variants have been proposed: i) the maximal covering location problem (MCLP), which requires choosing a subset of facilities that maximizes the demand covered while respecting a budget constraint on the cost of the facilities; ii) the partial set covering location problem (PSCLP), which minimizes the cost of the open facilities while forcing a certain amount of demand to be covered.\r\n\r\nWe study an effective decomposition approach to the MCLP and PSCLP based on the Benders-cut reformulation.

An integer linear programming model is proposed that takes into account various scheduling and routing constraints, availability related constraint, location of vessels and tankers capacity constraints. In addition, time window constraints are integrated into the proposed model. The model applies penalties on vessels in the case they requires service out of the time window that they have advanced.

Countries are myopic when they ignore each other’s security efforts, and the terrorist group only considers the weakest link’s security efforts. A comparison between the scenarios shows that for an extremely impatient Large country, full awareness yields a greater level of security effort for the Large country, a greater level of security effort for the Small country, and, because of backlash, more terrorist attacks. One predicable result is that both countries will blame each other for their failures in curbing terrorist activities. Stability analysis, however, shows that this is an unstable equilibrium.

The tournament is spread over 2 years, so the double rounds are months apart. After using the same mirrored schedule for about twenty years, and persistent complaints from its members, CONMEBOL decided to change the schedule for the 2018 World Cup. We used integer programming to construct schedules that overcome the main drawbacks of the previous approach. After exploring many design criteria, we proposed a candidate schedule that considerably improved the balance (usually perceived as fairness) of the schedule. In particular, it satisfies that every team plays once at home and once away on each double round, a feature that we show is impossible to capture in the format used by practitioners before. In addition, our schedule resembles symmetric features of long-lasting tradition. Our proposal was unanimously approved by CONMEBOL members and was used in the qualifier tournament for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia.

In view of\r\ngrowing emissions, research on optimizing public transport is more relevant than ever.\r\n\r\nThe classical approach in public transportation planning is the following: After the network design, the lines and their\r\nfrequencies are planned. Based on these, the timetable is determined, and later on the vehicles’ and drivers’ schedules. In order to account for the passengers, their routes are estimated after each of these stages and then used as input for the next stage.\r\nThese single planning stages are well understood and many of them can algorithmically be treated. However, following the above sketched sequential approach may be far away from finding an optimal solution for the whole system. This calls for integrated optimization.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present approaches for integrated optimization in public transportation, apply them to benchmark examples and discuss\r\nhow useful they are. While we focus on public transportation, many of the underlying ideas can also be used in other application areas.\r\n\r\nIntegrated versus sequential optimization.\r\nThe sequential procedure sketched above can be regarded as a Greedy approach: in each planning stage one aims at the best one can\r\ndo. This usually leads to suboptimal solutions. On the other hand, many of these single steps are already NP hard such that solving the\r\nintegrated problem to optimality seems to be out of scope. Nevertheless, we show how improvements can be made using the\r\nEigenmodel as a framework for (heuristic) integrated optimization. We furthermore introduce the price of sequentiality as a measure how much can be\r\ngained by integrated approaches.\r\n\r\nIntegrating passengers’ routes.\r\nWhile many models in public transportation aim to minimize the traveling time of the passengers, the behavior of the passengers is\r\nnot reflected realistically in most approaches. In many models, passengers are routed before the optimization. These routes are then\r\nfixed and are the basis for finding good line plans and timetables. We show that such a first routing has an immense impact on the resulting\r\nline plan, the timetable, the travel time and the costs. Better results are obtained if the routes of the passengers are variables which\r\nare determined within the optimization. However, these models are even harder to solve. We show two tricks to make such models tractable.\r\n\r\nFinally, both aspects are combined, again in the framework of the Eigenmodel.\r\nWe also show how more realistic models such as taking the vehicles’ capacities into account, or using logit models can be heuristically treated within this framework.
