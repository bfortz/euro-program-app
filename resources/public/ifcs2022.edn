The\r\nusefulness of the algorithm is verified through some simulated data (as in the plots\r\nbelow) and applied to real data sets. More details can be found in [2].\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1.

However, the validity of the normality assumption for individual groups is\r\noften violated. In such cases, distributions that can model skewness as well as heavy\r\ntail behavior are often chosen as mixture components.

This\r\nmay lead to inconsistent soil maps, for example, organic carbon and nitrogen maps\r\nproduced independently may show unrealistic carbon-nitrogen ratios. The latter is\r\nimportant as these ratios are used by map users to obtain information on residue\r\ndecomposition and the nitrogen cycle in the soil.

First, with respect to the current\r\npraxis of equating high interpretability with low complexity, we argue that while\r\nshorter rules are important for discrimination, longer rules are often more interpretable \r\nthan shorter rules, and that the tendency of current rule learning algorithms\r\nto strive for short and concise rules should be replaced with alternative methods that\r\nallow for longer concept descriptions.

Traditionally,\r\na model is fitted to each time series and then a dissimilarity matrix is generated\r\nfrom distances between models. This approach has a few limitations. Time series\r\nare notoriously difficult to fit, exhibiting problems such temporal dependency, low\r\nsample size and nonstationarity. Moreover, when clustering a large number time\r\nseries, we often have to rely on automatic fitting procedures without human supervision.\r\nThese problems lead to models with poor predictive accuracy. However, a\r\nnew paradigm has emerged in time series prediction, the so-called cross-learning or\r\nglobal model approach. A group of time series is pooled together and fitted with a\r\nsingle model, called a ‚Äòglobal‚Äô model, and a single predictive function is then used\r\nfor all of the time series in the group. Global models are showing superior accuracy\r\ncompared with traditional single-series (or ‚Äòlocal‚Äô) models in a vast number of\r\napplications. Global models can be used for clustering, by finding a grouping that\r\nmaximizes the predictive accuracy of the global models fitted to each group. This\r\napproach has an important side-effect, it introduces the conceptof predictive accuracy\r\nas a measure of a cluster quality: given a model class and a dataset,the quality\r\nof a given clustering is the average predictive error of the global. This measure also\r\nserves to select the often unknown parameter of the number of clusters.\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce the idea of using global models for clustering time\r\nseries, showcasing several algorithms and results on simulation and real datasets.\r\nThe time series models include the classical linear autoregressive family, but also\r\nneural networks and decision trees.

Robust\r\nsubspace clustering methods try to discover those linear subspaces while avoiding\r\nthe effect of outlying values. Detecting anomalies in the data can be an interesting\r\nproblem in itself, as well as taking advantage of the subspace clustering structure to\r\n‚Äùreconstruct‚Äù the data prior to the data contamination process.\r\n  Some robustified subspace clustering methods, that follow from the application of\r\ntrimming principles, will be reviewed. A proportion \\alpha of entire cases were proposed\r\nto be trimmed in [1] and a proportion \\alpha of individual cells were trimmed in [2]. These\r\napproaches provide good robustness but require the specification of a trimming rate\r\n\\alpha.

(2) Compared with large-scale general\r\ndomain data, could transformer models work effectively on a small legal-specific\r\ndomain dataset? Our experimental results showed that the transformer-based predictive \r\nmodels achieved the F1 scores ranged between 0.73 and 0.83 on the detection of\r\nthe six industry sectors.

Here, our aim is to ‚Äúmake measurable‚Äù the notions of ‚Äúconcordance‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscordance‚Äù \r\nusually used between behaviours, events, ideas, results, etc. For example, we can measure \r\nthe ‚Äúconcordance‚Äù between a country and the European countries for some given variables \r\nrelated to corona. Also, the ‚Äúconcordance‚Äù of a solar star with a collection of solar stars \r\nhaving a planet, the ‚Äúconcordance‚Äù of a stock and a portfolio of stocks in their behaviour \r\nduring a given period, a new species with a family of species, etc. The Kendall ‚Äúconcordance‚Äù \r\nand ‚Äúdiscordance‚Äù are used to compare ordinal variables, that is why ‚Äús-concordance‚Äù and \r\n‚Äús-discordance‚Äù are used here (‚Äús‚Äù for ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù as symbolic data are used). The ‚Äús-concordance‚Äù \r\nor ‚Äús-discordance‚Äù definition between a class c and a collection P of given classes for\r\na given value x (or vector of values), needs two basic densities. Roughly said, the\r\nfirst is f_c(x) which expresses the proportion of the x value of a descriptive variable\r\n(which can be multidimensional) inside the class c and the second is g_x(c) which\r\nexpresses the proportion of classes of P which have a proportion of the x value\r\nequal or close to f_c(x). Then, the ‚Äús-concordance‚Äù (resp. s-discordance) denoted\r\nS_conc(c, P, x) (resp. S_disc(c, P, x)) satisfies natural axioms. From the given data,\r\nspecific families of concordance can be induced by using the copulas obtained from\r\nthe joint distribution function of the random variables which densities are f_c and g_x.\r\nS-concordance and s-discordance differ from similarities and dissimilarities by their\r\nmeaning but also by their axiomatic definition. The s-discordance has as a specific\r\ncase the Tf-Idf. S-concordance and s-discordance have numerous impacts in data\r\nscience. These impacts are illustrated in the case of the k-means, dynamical clustering, \r\nhierarchical or pyramidal clustering, mixture decomposition, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, \r\nstatistical inference and likelihood.

When\r\nthe total number of counts depends on varying external factors (e.g. duration of the\r\ncounting process or ability to measure a count), the relative magnitude of the observed\r\nvalues is of special importance. These data are called point-counting data in some\r\napplied fields, and they are affected by compositional variability and multinomial\r\ncounting uncertainties [4]. For clustering analysis purposes, it is crucial to consider\r\nboth sources of variability. Compositional variability is commonly modeled using\r\nthe Dirichlet or the logratio-normal distribution, leading respectively to the classical\r\nDirichlet-multinomial distribution and the logratio-normal-multinomial (LRNM)\r\ndistribution [2]. In model-based clustering, these models are usually included as\r\ncomponents in a finite mixture model [1,3].\r\n  In this contribution, we propose a fast approach for clustering analysis of pointcounting \r\ndata based on the LRNM model. A part of the procedure takes care of the\r\ncompositional aspect through logratio coordinates, including the treatment of zero\r\ncounts as necessary. Moreover, through the computation of the posterior distribution\r\nconditioned to the measured variability and the observed data, the multinomial\r\nvariability is accounted for by using simulated samples of the latent compositional\r\nprocess. These samples are combined into a final partition of the original sample by\r\nusing clustering ensembling methods.

How to define such distance depends on the nature of the \r\ndata and/or problem at hand. For distance between numerical variables, in particular \r\nin multivariate contexts, there exist many definitions that depend on the actual observed\r\ndifferences between values. It is worth underlining that often it is necessary to rescale\r\nthe variables before computing the distances. Many distance functions exist for numerical \r\nvariables, see [2] for a detailed list.

Research on poverty uses both objective and \r\nsubjective indicators. Objective measures do not show the complete nature of \r\npoverty as they only examine economic conditions, mainly household income or \r\nexpenses, or their basic needs. Hence, our research focuses on subjective poverty, \r\nwhich includes the diversity of perceptions of poverty among respondents. The aim \r\nof the research is to present and compare methodological approaches to the \r\nconstruction of a synthetic measure of subjective household poverty. The research \r\ntook into account the aggregation of variables describing the past, present, and \r\nfuture. The procedure of constructing a synthetic measure utilized the measure of \r\ndistance between triangular fuzzy numbers [2] and the generalized distance measure \r\n[5]. However, the aggregation of variables relied on three fuzzy methods based on \r\nthe ideas of Hellwig [3], TOPSIS [4] and Chen [1]. The approaches were used to assess \r\nthe level of subjective household poverty in Poland. The study was based on data \r\ncollected using the CAWI method in April 2021. The use of fuzzy approaches to the \r\nassessment of subjective poverty allows more precise determination of its level than \r\nwith the standard measurement. In addition, the subjective poverty measure can \r\nalso be used as a basis for formulating poverty reduction strategies.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1.

Whereas previous \r\nstudies analyze these comments by sentiment analysis or use of profanity only,\r\nin this exploratory approach, the analysis of negative comments on YouTube is \r\nexpanded on by combining sentiment analysis [1], a dictionary approach for defining\r\nand matching video topics using automatically generated transcripts, a dictionary\r\nmatching for swear words [2], and video and comment metadata. A small group of\r\ncontent creators was selected for the analysis.\r\n  The combination of comment sentiment, the relation to a video and use of profanity \r\nallowed for the classification into four groups of different sizes: Impoliteness,\r\nIncivility, Flaming and Criticism [3].\r\n  Comparing approaches, sentiment analysis alone shows a similar prevalence of\r\nnegative comments between creators.

However, it also led to the introduction of\r\nharmful addiction phenomena, and to the spread of cyberbullying and cyberterrorism\r\nactivities. As a result, monitoring operations on the content published by users, as\r\nwell as on their behavior, has become critical to ensure a correct and safe use of social\r\nmedias. This monitoring process becomes very difficult in presence of borderline\r\nusers, i.e., users who appear to act in safe way based on their posted content, but not\r\naccording to other viewpoints (e.g., their relationships), and viceversa.\r\n  In this context, this abstract contributes towards an effective identification of\r\nrisky users in social networks. Specifically, we propose a novel method that solves\r\nnode classification tasks in social networks by exploiting the information conveyed\r\nby three different perspectives: the semantics of the textual content generated by\r\nusers, the network of user relationships, and the users spatial closeness, derived\r\nfrom geo-tagging metadata associated with posted contents.\r\n  Existing approaches that consider multiple perspectives are mainly based on the\r\ninjection of features identified from one perspective into the other [2], or are tailored\r\nfor the analysis of the network structure and node attributes, without being able to\r\ncapture the semantics of the generated content [1].

An echelon scan method we have proposed uses\r\nechelon‚Äôs hierarchical structures to perform hotspot detection [2], and thereby has\r\nbecome possible to detect an arbitrary shaped cluster even when large amounts of\r\ndata are targeted, which is difficult to detect by the conventional method. In this\r\nstudy, we introduce the R package for the echelon analysis and echelon scan method\r\nwe have developed [1], and the web application that can execute these methods while\r\nperforming them interactively. In addition, an example of analysis using actual data\r\nwill be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1.

We here address the problem\r\nof classification in the context of partially observed functional data based on Depth\r\nto-Depth classifiers [1]. To do that, we propose an integrated functional depth for\r\npartially observed functional data [2], dealing with the very challenging case where\r\npartial observability can occur systematically on any observation of the functional\r\ndataset. In particular, differently from many techniques for partially observed \r\nfunctional data, we do not request that some functional datum is fully observed, nor \r\nwe require that a common domain exist, where all of the functional data are recorded.\r\nBecause of this, our proposal can also be used in those frequent situations where\r\nreconstructions methods and other techniques for partially observed functional data\r\nare inapplicable. By means of simulation studies, we demonstrate the very good\r\nperformances of the proposed depth on finite samples.

One of the common forms of natural\r\nlaws in the composition is the constant logcontrast relationship between parts, usually\r\nindicating a compositional system at an equilibrium state. A statistical approach to\r\ndetecting this form of law includes two steps: 1) collecting appropriate data for\r\nthe analysis, and 2) choosing proper statistical methods to analyze the data. In\r\nthe aspect of statistical methodology, ample studies have shown that the logratio\r\nprincipal component analysis (LR-PCA) is an effective tool for detecting the constant\r\nlogcontrast patterns [1, 2]. However, though the sampling design is also an important\r\naspect of statistical design, limited literature discusses its effect on drawing accurate\r\nconclusions about the laws in composition. Therefore, this study aims to investigate\r\nthe limitations of different sampling methods on LR-PCA procedure and develop\r\nmore suitable sampling strategies for law detection.\r\n  Through a simulation study of genotype frequencies in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), \r\nwe found that when generating a 3D compositional data set containing HWE law, if one variable \r\nis assigned an exact value and thus has a small variance, the ratios between pair-wise variables \r\nare close to constants.

Thanks\r\nto their interpretability, decision trees have been intensively studied for classification\r\ntasks, and, due to the remarkable advances in mixed-integer programming (MIP),\r\nvarious approaches have been proposed to formulate the Optimal Classification Tree\r\n(OCT) problem as a MIP model starting from the seminal paper [2]. We present\r\na novel MIQP formulation for binary classification using OCT and exploiting the\r\ngeneralization capabilities of Support Vector Machines. The maximum MARGin\r\nOptimal Classification Tree (MARGOT) selects at each node of the decision tree a\r\nmaximum margin separating hyperplane using an l_2-norm linear SVM (see e.g. [1]\r\nand references therein). The resulting model combines such multivariate hyperplanes\r\nminimizing the global misclassification error. The model can also include feature\r\nselection constraints, following e.g. [3], which allows to define a hierarchy on the\r\nsubsets of features which mostly affect the outcome. MARGOT has been tested on\r\nnon-linearly separable synthetic datasets in a 2-features space in order to provide\r\na graphical representation of the optimal hyperplanes.

A recent search\r\nat the web of science (using the core collection) reveals there are well over 2,200\r\nscientific articles that refer to biplots since the term was first coined by Gabriel [1].\r\nSeveral textbooks on biplots are available with a varying level of mathematical depth,\r\nthough classical textbooks on multivariate analysis have been slow at incorporating\r\nthe concept, or at recognising its universal value for all classical methods that are\r\nbased on the singular value decomposition.\r\n  In applied scientific studies, several aspects of biplot construction and interpretation \r\nare still not well understood, to the point that it is easy to find a poor biplot\r\nin a high-impact scientific journal. Some of the more problematic aspects will be\r\naddressed in the talk and concern: the choice of the multivariate method, aspect ratio, \r\nbiplot scaling, interpretation rules and (sub)optimality of approximations among\r\nothers. There is a lot of software available for making biplots, but in spite of this, the\r\ntruth is that many users would not be able to make an optimal biplot for representing\r\none of the most elementary matrices: the correlation matrix.\r\n  The growing size of datasets being analysed poses an important challenge to\r\nbiplot methodology.

At this\r\npoint, optimality refers to the most favorable expected (potential) outcome if the\r\nrule would be applied to the entire population of patients of interest.

As a\r\nresult, these models can have a significant drop in performance with a negative impact\r\non overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). OEE is the gold standard in manufacturing\r\nthat defines productivity based on availability, performance and quality. In this\r\nregard, OEE decreases when workpieces produced under the new distribution are\r\nwrongly categorized as faulty workpieces, slowing down the manufacturing process\r\nby unnecessary and excessive manual quality measurements.\r\n  To avoid this kind of problem in production, anomaly detection systems must\r\nbe constantly evaluated, if necessary, retrained to the new data distribution and redeployed. \r\nInstead of adopting a manual and time-demanding workflow, continual learning approaches could \r\nacquire novel information from a continuous data stream.

However, both unbalanced and\r\nrare events data have been studied as statistical problems with possible applications\r\nin different fields such as biology, political science, engineering, economics and\r\nmedicine. The unbalanced variables related to rare events are difficult to predict and\r\nexplain, specially in high dimensional settings and in presence of massive datasets,\r\nwhere unbalancing might be even more critical.\r\n  The logistic model may not be appropriate for such data since it strongly underestimates \r\nthe probability of rare events because the estimators tend to be biased\r\ntowards the majority class, which is usually less critical.

GT yields a measure of the interest \r\nof Google search-engine users in a subject or a specific keyword over time,\r\nresulting in a normalised index [1]. The benefits of GT as a data supplier include\r\nits promptness, inexpensive collection costs, mixed sampling frequency and approaches \r\nto diversified research areas. There are, however, two issues associated with GT that \r\nrequire attention.

In this scenario an useful statistical technique is density\r\nestimation which represents an important source of information. One dimensional\r\ndensity functions represent a special case of functional data subject to the constraints\r\nto be non-negative and with a constant integral equal to one [1]. Because of these\r\nconstraints, densities functions do not form a vector space and a naive application of\r\nfunctional data analysis (FDA) methods may lead to non valid estimates. To address\r\nthis issue two main strategies can be found in the literature. In the first, the probability\r\ndensity functions (pdfs) are mapped into a linear functional space through a suitably\r\nchosen transformation [2]. Established methods for Hilbert space valued data can\r\nbe applied to the transformed functions and the results are moved back into the\r\ndensity space by means of the inverse transformation. In the second strategy, pdfs\r\nare treated as an infinite dimensional compositional data since they are part of some\r\nwhole which only carry relative information. An approach based on the Aitchison\r\ngeometry for compositional data has been sketched in [3, 4].

These replicates can\r\nthen be used to provide insight into the tuning parameters for the specific clustering\r\ntechniques. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through simulations\r\nand applications to real-life datasets.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n1. Ramsay, JO and Silverman, BW.: Functional Data Analysis.

The study focuses on the period from\r\nthe detection of the first case in the country (26th February 2020) to the first week of\r\n2022 (08th January 2022). Data analysis was based on Correspondence Analysis on\r\na fuzzy-coded contingency table, followed by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)\r\non the factor scores.
