The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.\r\nThe tree which we develop consists, in each node, to decide if we retain a given object or not. This makes it easy to test all possible cases. After the separation of solutions in a tree, we deal with the evaluation of each node: We traverse the tree node by node, we ignore branches of a node whose weight is higher than the capacity of the sack and we keep among all the solutions that one whose utility is maximum and its weight is minimal. We can easily note that if we horizontally cut the previous tree on the level of the root, we obtain two distinct and complementary sets. Taking in count  this observation, we project to develop a tree where each node will comprise a solution and its complement which enables us to divide the size of the tree by two. As each node comprises a solution and its complement this gives to the branches a new maning: the first branch corresponds to the addition (respectively withdrawal) of the object from the current solution in the following level (respectively the complement). The second branch means that the object was not added to (respectively removed from) the solution (respectively the complement) of the current node. Besides saving memory capacity, this representation enables us to gain in time at the evaluation phase of the nodes.

Based on the DECO model in which all correlations are equal and large covariance matrices can be estimated with ease, we compute the correlations among commodities, developed and emerging markets as distinct asset classes. Consequently, we find that the correlations between commodities and stock markets display an upward trend, which may imply the financialization process of commodities and their diminishing benefits from diversification. Additionally, DECO models show the increased co-movement across all the markets during the global financial meltdown. Commodity and emerging markets as two asset groups exhibit the lowest level of correlations through time, relative to the developed markets. Furthermore, the bivariate conditional correlations between each commodity and each stock market are generated from the DCC models to investigate the linkages between the individual assets. Our results from the DCC models depict volatile correlations at different magnitudes.

The algorithm we propose is a combination of stratification, importance sampling based on cross-entropy, and inner replications using the geometric shortcut method. We evaluate the efficiency of our general method considering three different examples: CreditRisk+ and two of the latent variable models, the Gaussian and the t-copula model. Numerical results suggest that the proposed general algorithm is more efficient than the benchmark methods for these specific models.

While several numerical techniques, such as Tikhonov regularization, Spline interpolations have been suggested to tackle this problem, we seek a more direct and robust approach.

It is suitable for modeling asset returns under the normal distribution assumption; however, empirical analysis suggests that this hypothesis is not realistic. \r\nRecently a new distribution named Mixed Tempered Stable (MixedTS from now on) has been introduced. It has been employed for univariate risk measurement and for portfolio selection. This distribution is a generalization of the Normal Variance Mean Mixtures (NVMM henceforth) since the structure is similar but its definition generates a dependence of higher moments on the parameters of the Tempered Stable  that replaces the Normal distribution. Note that in the NVMM skewness and kurtosis depend only on the mixing r.v. parameters. Fat tails in NVMM are reproduced only if the mixing r.v. is fat tailed. Through the MixedTS it is possible to model portfolio returns without any particular assumption on the heavy tailedness of the mixing r.v since the Tempered Stable has the alpha−Stable distribution as a limit case and the Geometric Stable is obtained for particular choice of parameters. \r\nThe idea of this paper is to model directly portfolio returns by means of the multivariate MixedTS distribution built through a multivariate mixing random variable. The dependence of the mixing random variable components control the dependence structure in the new distribution. In literature, a similar approach has been used for the construction of a multivariate Variance Gamma distribution. The Semeraro's model considers as mixing r.v a Gamma distribution that is a semi-heavy tailed distribution. As it was observed, this model seems to be too restrictive for describing the joint distribution of asset returns. In particular, the sign of the covariance of components depends on the sign of the skewness of marginal distributions. We overcome this limit since through the MixedTS there are more possible combinations of the signs of the covariance and marginals skewness. In this work, we use the new flexible distribution in portfolio selection. Optimal weights are obtained maximizing both the analytical and the approximated formula of the expected utility for a CARA function.

Repeated observations of an individual have a tendency to be correlated.

There are two main approaches to model heterogeneity: subject specific (SS) models and population-averaged (PA) models. An example for subject specific models is mixed linear model that includes both fixed effects and random effects. In recent years, generalized linear mixed models have gained popularity as a statistical modeling tool for non-Gaussian outcomes. In subject specific models, heterogeneity is explicitly modeled.\r\nThe second approach also known as marginal models in the literature.

Data mining practices are implemented in order to build classification models that can discriminate \"financially safe\" from \"distressed\" businesses. The data analyzed contain financial variables collected from balance sheets and profit or loss reports referring to businesses located in the regions of China, India, Africa and Asia, characterized as emerging markets. The business population used for our classification experiments comprises nearly 17,000 firms from more than 80 subsectors of activity. Since \"distressed\" businesses are always a small percentage compared to the \"financially safe\" the datasets used are characterized by major class imbalance. In credit scoring industry the most popular algorithm for building corporate risk classifiers is logistic regression. Its predictive performance, however, is severely degraded because of the underrepresented distribution of financially distressed cases and the scalar differences of the input variable values. We follow a data level analytical process through a limited rebalancing practice regarding the training samples to help logistic regression cope with misleading predictions, in contrast to the usual practice of credit rating agencies who undersample the training sets so as to become totally balanced. Well established resampling techniques as random undersampling, Tomek links undersampling and Synthetic Minority (SMOTE) oversampling are applied in a comparative manner to a proposed alternative cluster boundary undersampling technique. The proposed resampling approach combines the majority instances selection criteria rational with an optimal discretization of continuous variables, a routine that helps the k-means algorithm to build compact and balanced clusters. Then a sophisticated selection of within clusters majority cases, based on cluster centroid distance, is done so as to remove redundant majority information from training sets. The experimental results to be presented here reveal that this kind of cluster boundary alternative boosts the performance of logistic regression regardless of the imbalance level or the geographical origin of data. Moreover, it is proved to be quite more effective than the other resampling techniques. Moreover, the combination of the proposed cluster undersampling practice with synthetic minority oversampling proved to be the best performing practice, at least as far as the logistic regression ability to predict distressed businesses.

One of the first examples of miscalculation occurred in computation of option prices and discovered after the stock market crash of 1987 and lead to numerous studies criticizing the Black&Scholes&Merton (BSM) option pricing model. These studies lead to the notion of implied volatility and volatility smile/skew, which can be seen as one of the first attempts to compute the model specific miscalculations of the values of financial quantities (inconsistency of model calculated values and market values).\r\nAs the financial markets get bigger and more complicated, the frequency and arguably the magnitude of the financial crisis have increased. This situation have caused the financial engineering to focus on studies to first define and then to model the stability of financial markets. In order to achieve this goal, one must first be able to define, model and measure the stability of the computed values of financial quantities and furthermore the models used to compute those values. In case of the BSM model, the Greeks were used to model and measure the stability of option prices with respect to small changes in the model parameters. But as the more complex models have been developed, mode advanced mathematical tools needed, one of which is the Malliavin calculus or the stochastic calculus of variations. \r\nThe Malliavin calculus allows one to investigate the effect of changes in the model parameters on the risk-neutral probability measure which is used to compute the prices of financial quantities. Recent studies on application of the Malliavin calculus techniques to financial markets resulted in the definition of quantities such as the price-volatility feedback effect rate and the local vega index. In their book, Malliavin and Thalmaier have shown that the price-volatility feedback effect rate is shown to be used for characterizing the hedging cost of an option as the time to maturity increases.  Later, Kohatsu-Higa has shown that the local vega index can be used to characterize the probability of obtaining a perfect hedge of options and Ewald has shown that the Malliavin calculus techniques can be used to compute the expected volatility at maturity conditioned on the stock price value at maturity under the Heston stochastic volatility model.\r\nIn this study, we investigate the relation between the price-volatility feedback effect rate, the local vega index and the local volatility and their implications on the hedging and pricing of options under several models including stochastic volatility models both theoretically and numerically.\r\n", :title "Investigation of the Cost and Probability of Hedging via the Malliavin Calculus", :keyword2 16, :authors (31390 23157), :session 18}, 135 {:keyword1 10, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Natural gas is one of the main energy sources in the world.

They function in a similar manner as the circuit breakers in the US exchanges.  Advocates of price limits argue that establishing such limits will not interfere with trading activity on an exchange.  Opponents of price limits assert that these limits can be the source of higher volatility on subsequent trading days or can delay full incorporation of information into prices or can interfere with trading activities of investors.  Previous research on the subject provides conflicting evidence (Kyle, 1988; Ma, Rao and Sears, 1989; Kuhn, Kurserk and Locke, 1991; Kim and Rhee, 1997).  \r\nThe objective of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of the price limit system employed at the Borsa Istanbul (BIST)-an emerging market that has attracted a lot of attention from international money managers recently.  The BIST is a fully-automated, order-matching market.  Such a system enables fast dissemination of information among investors (Naidu and Rozeff, 1994).  Also, the trading takes place in separate morning and afternoon sessions.  Thus, price volatility can be expected to be higher in such a market and price limits may help to control this volatility.  Hence, with its characteristics, BIST provides an excellent platform for studying the impact of price limits on stock price volatility.  \r\nFor analysis, daily stock price data for the period from January 2, 1995 to December 31, 2014 are used.  During this period, there are two types of price stabilization mechanisms employed by the BIST: tick size and trading session price limit.  The tick size rule specifies the minimum allowable price change from one trade to the other and the tick size varies with the security price.  The trading session price limit rule determines the maximum allowable percentage change in the price of a security during a session and this limit is ten percent during the sample period analyzed in this paper.  \r\nFor examining the impact of price limits, this paper performs two different tests. The first set of tests aims to determine whether hitting a price limit on a given day has an impact on the volatility of stock prices during the subsequent trading days.  For this purpose, for a window of ten days around the limit day, the daily price volatility of stocks that hit the limit is compared to that of stocks that did not hit the price limit.  The second set of tests is conducted to determine whether hitting a price limit on a given day has an impact on the volume of trading during the subsequent days.  For these tests, over a ten-day event window, the daily volume of trading for stocks that hit the limit is compared to that of stocks that did not hit the limit. \r\n", :title "Effectiveness of Price Limits in Controlling Daily Stock Price Volatility", :keyword2 0, :authors (47236 47238), :session 33}, 150 {:keyword1 17, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In this study, a comparative analysis of numerical and approximation methods for pricing American options is performed.

Especially in emerging electricity markets, where electricity traders act as market makers and set fictive spreads due to strategic or other purposes, traditional models for illiquidity risk measures, stochastic volatility and price processes as well as derivatives pricing techniques have to be adjusted to reflect the country and market specific characteristics. That is, there is no complete or missing academic research, applying the combined effect of illiquidity, \"random\" events in the market, low transparency and low frequency data in electricity markets. These require the development and application of case and country-specific, liquidity-adjusted risk premiums, spread models, risk measures and derivatives pricing techniques.

For instance, POE is used to estimate probability that assets of a company fall below liabilities. POE measures only the frequency of outcomes and ignores magnitude of outcomes.  POE counts outcomes exceeds the threshold, and it \"does not worry\" about the amount by which each outcome exceeds the threshold.  POE is lumping together all threshold exceedance events, potentially “hiding” quite large and very troublesome outcomes. Moreover, POE has poor mathematical properties when used to characterize discrete distributions of random values, e.g., when distributions are defined by previously observed historical data. POE for discrete distributions is a discontinuous function of control variables, making it difficult to analyze and optimize.\r\n\r\nThis paper investigates a new probabilistic characteristic called buffered probability of exceedance (bPOE). With bPOE, it is possible to count outcomes similar to a threshold value, rather than only outcomes exceeding the threshold. To be more precise, bPOE counts tail outcomes averaging to some specific threshold value. For instance, 4% of land-falling hurricanes in US have cumulative damage exceeding $50 billion (i.e., POE = 0.04 for threshold=$50 billion). It is estimated, that the average damage from the worst 10% of hurricanes is $50 billion. In terms of bPOE, we say bPOE=0.1 for threshold=$50 billion. bPOE shows that largest damages having magnitude around $50 billion have frequency 10%. bPOE  can be considered as an important supplement to POE. We think that bPOE should be routinely calculated together with POE. This example shows that bPOE exceeds POE, which is why it is called Buffered Probability of Exceedance.  The positive difference, bPOE-POE, can be interpreted as some \"buffer.\" The bPOE concept was recently developed as an extension of Buffered Probability of Failure (introduced by Rockafellar and Royset). bPOE has been derived from Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) characteristic of uncertainty. Actually, bPOE is an inverse function of CVaR and it inherits a majority of the exceptional mathematical properties of CVaR (which is a so called \"coherent measure of risk\"). Similar to CVaR, minimization of bPOE can be reduced to convex and Linear Programming.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss two applications of bPOE concept. The first application considers the Cash Matching of a Bond Portfolio. We minimize bPOE that assets exceed liabilities. The second application uses bPOE in data mining. Currently, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) is standardly used to evaluate classification models.

G20 has defined financial stability as the 'Resilience of the financial system to unanticipated adverse shocks to enable the continued functioning of the financial intermediation process.' Properly designed pension funds can easily absorb adverse price shocks and earn the associated risk premiums because they can diversify these risks over time.\r\n\r\nSince a large portion of financial assets in emerging markets is held by \"international\" investors (for example, more than 65% of the floating value of BIST), these markets are more and differently exposed to systemic risks.
