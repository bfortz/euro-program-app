This presentation focuses on the problem of minimizing CO2 emissions in the routing of vehicles in urban areas. In urban areas, we assume that the vehicle must travel at the speed of traffic, which is both variable and time-dependent. Visiting multiple stops over the course of a day, each customer has a pickup of a particular weight, and as a result, the weight of the vehicle changes as pickups are made. The emissions-minimizing path between any two customers can vary due to the impact of time-dependent speeds as well as the load on the vehicle. Thus, the best path between each pair of customers cannot as a rule be precomputed as in most vehicle routing problems which creates computational challenges.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem, we adapt an existing tabu search algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time-dependent travel times. We take advantage of an analytical result that allows us to precompute many of the required paths between customers. In the cases where we cannot precompute the paths, we solve a time-dependent, deterministic minimum emissions cost path problem while constructing routes. We test our approach with instances derived from a real road network  and experiment with different numbers of vehicles, vehicle weights,  and customer pickup quantities. Savings of up to 20% in emissions can be achieved when minimizing emissions for suburban customers compared to time-dependent travel time optimized tours.", :title "Vehicle Routing to Minimize Time-Dependent Emissions in Urban Areas", :keyword2 47, :authors (16919 27111 7172), :session 15}, 14 {:keyword1 50, :keyword3 37, :abstract "This paper introduces the fleet size and mix pollution-routing problem which extends the pollution-routing problem by considering a heterogeneous vehicle fleet.

Solving this problem poses several methodological challenges. To this end, we have developed a powerful metaheuristic which was successfully applied to a large pool of realistic benchmark instances. Several analyses were conducted to shed light on the trade-offs between various performance indicators, including capacity utilization, fuel and emissions and costs pertaining to vehicle acquisition, fuel consumption and drivers.

The operational relevance of the routing algorithm depends on the good estimation of the container waste volumes at the time of executing the tours, which are often planned several days ahead. To this end, we develop a waste generation model from spatially disaggregated historical data on daily container volumes, population density, geography, spatial container interaction measures, weather, holidays, and container specific effects. Derived from a dynamic spatial panel regression, the model is able to forecast individual container volumes, successfully capturing the strong weekly seasonality pattern in waste generation.

In this problem a decision maker has to determine when to visit each costumer, how much to deliver each time, and how to arrange the costumers to be visited into different routes. The objective in the general case of the problem is to minimize the total inventory handling costs and the distribution costs jointly, while serving the demand in a satisfactory way.\r\nInspired by real-life data and an industrial partner arising in the automated teller machine (ATM) industry, we study an IRP variant where stock outs are allowed. Our industry partner, from the city of Santiago, Chile, is in charge of the replenishment of some ATMs located throughout the city. Their goal is to replenish ATMs such that the forecasted demand can be satisfied. Stock‐outs are allowed, but the operator has to pay a fine for the demand that is lost while the machines are out of stock. The set of decisions involve defining replenishment days and quantities, as well as the routing of the vehicles throughout the serviced ATMs.\r\nIn this research we develop an ad-hoc exact branch‐and‐cut algorithm for the IRP in which stock outs are allowed, to be capable of handle the case study proposed by our partner. We solve a mixed integer linear problem implementing a branch-and-cut algorithm in C++ using CPLEX Concert. The subtour elimination constraints are originally relaxed, and then added dynamically when they are found to be violated during the iterations of the algorithm.\r\nThis algorithm is capable of proving optimality for instances containing up to 15 nodes and 6 planning periods, and high quality solutions are obtained for larger instances using a preprocessing phase based on clustering procedures.

In essence, what makes the problem of determining locations of alternative-fuel stations different from those of petrol stations is the scarcity of current infrastructure. This topic is especially timely in the light of a recent European directive requiring Member States to provide a minimum coverage of such refuelling points. The flow-refuelling location model (FRLM) has its origins in the flow-capturing location model (FCLM). In turn, the FCLM is based on the observation that, unlike traditional location models, where facilities are to be sited near customer locations, in some cases it makes more sense to locate facilities near routes that customers already take. An important aspect of the FCLM is that any flow is captured by a single facility. The main difference of the FRLM from the FCLM is that a single facility may be unable to capture an entire flow, due to the issue of “limited range”, namely, that some journeys cannot be undertaken with a single refuelling stop. (This model is applicable to vehicles powered by alternative fuels, as they normally cover relatively shorter distances on a full tank.) We propose an efficient heuristic for the FRLM that is based on the concept of solving sets of restricted subproblems. (In this respect it is somewhat similar to Kernel Search.) We also use a parallel computing strategy to reduce computation effort. We have carried out computational experiments on well-known benchmark datasets.  Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain optimal solutions within a reasonable computation time and outperforms the other heuristics from the literature.

An item can only be delivered if it is at the rear of a stack. This problem arises in the transportation of heavy or dangerous material where unnecessary handling should be avoided, such as in the transportation of cars between car dealers and the transportation of livestocks from farms to slaughterhouses. To solve this problem, we propose two different branch-price-and-cut algorithms. The first solves the shortest path problem with the LIFO multiple stacks policy, while the second incorporates this policy partly in the shortest path problem and adds additional inequalities to the master problem when infeasible LIFO multiple stacks routes are encountered.

We develop a heuristic that is algorithmically simple, produces solutions that are comparable in quality to those produced by existing approaches, and performs well with respect to metrics that quantify compactness and separation.  Our heuristic uses a partitioning scheme in which a node’s weight includes contributions from both incident streets requiring service and the distance needed to travel to a node.

In this work, we study a vehicle routing problem where delivery routes have to be organized with the additional constraint that goods to be delivered are not all available at the depot at the start of\r\nthe distribution phase. The routing problems should consider the additional issue of whether it is better to wait for additional goods to arrive and have a better loaded vehicle or to start a route\r\nof the vehicle with the currently available goods. We call this problem the Vehicle Routing Problem with release dates. We consider two special cases that are themselves declined in two variants: a case where a single vehicle is allowed to perform several trips during the time horizon (say, the day), one after the other, and  a case where a fleet of vehicles is limited to a single route each. In both cases, capacity constraints are not considered. We call the first case the Traveling Salesman Problem with release dates (TSP-rd) while the second is called the Uncapacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with release dates (UVRP-rd). For both cases we consider a first variant where the objective is to minimize the total traveling distance in such a way that all customers are served within a deadline. The second variant we consider is the one where we minimize the completion time which is given by the sum of the total traveling time and the waiting time. Practical motivations  for minimizing the completion time are the willingness to make the driver available as early as possible for further tasks or to avoid rush hours. Motivations to minimize the distance are related to cost or pollution minimization.

A limited number of RS is available. Once a battery has been completely consumed the vehicle automatically shift to traditional fuel propulsion mode.

For example, Dan, the largest bus operator in the greater Tel Aviv area, declared its plan to acquire 200 electric buses in the next few years. The transition to electric buses is motivated by the technological evolution of high-capacity batteries for electric vehicles and the growing public awareness to the shortfalls of the currently prevailing diesel technology. Due to the risk involved in adapting new technologies and because the operational lifespan of diesel buses is 12-15 years, it is likely that the transition to electric buses will occur gradually. Therefore, for an extended period, there will be a need to plan the transit system operation of fleets that contains at least two types of buses. These two types have significantly different operational cost structures and range limitations. In particular, the operational range of electric buses is limited and thus, charging or battery-swapping operations should be included in their daily schedule.\r\nThis study extends the classic bus scheduling models and solution methods to the more complex problem of scheduling mixed fleets.

Typically, a bicycle is used several times a day by different users. This increases the probability for damages, and indeed a small percentage of the fleet becomes broken every day. Currently, real-time information about the broken bicycles is not available for the operators or the users. As broken bicycles are not likely to be rented, it is unlikely that stations with broken bicycles will become empty. Therefore, the system may keep signaling to the users and the operators that there are available bicycles in such stations even though such bicycles are unusable. These occurrences may cause great inconvenience to the users due to the false information.

Each item is characterized by its weight, and its length and width dimensions, such that all items packed into a truck must respect its weight capacity and must fit its dimensions without overlapping. This variant of the VRP is significantly harder than the classical CVRP in the sense that it combines a packing problem and a vehicle routing problem.

We consider a group of suppliers each of which aims to establish one or more distribution centers, to be able to quickly and economically respond to customers orders from a given area. The customer orders are not in very large quantities, so the suppliers utilize the services of less-than-truckload (LTL) common carriers to deliver their products to the customers. LTL carriers typically charge less per unit weight as the shipment weight increases, resulting in a piecewise linear cost function. A customer location typically receives products from multiple suppliers. The suppliers are interested in collaborating with each other to reduce the cost of meeting customer demand. The collaboration model they consider entails establishing joint distribution centers to alleviate the burden of fixed facility costs, and consolidating outbound freight from each joint distribution center to reduce outbound transportation costs. In order to establish a successful collaboration, the suppliers must determine: (i) the members of the collaboration, (ii) the operational structure of the collaborative solution, and (iii) the method of sharing the costs of the collaboration. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we develop mathematical programming models which aim to select the optimal combination of partners, facility locations and customer assignments, and at the same time incorporate cost allocation decisions for the stability of the collaboration. Based on our review of the literature, this is one of the first studies covering all three of these important aspects.  The resulting models are selective facility location models with piecewise-linear transportation costs, which is not commonly used in the literature.

In this problem,  a set of identical vehicles located at a central depot must optimally be routed to serve a set of transportation requests, satisfying time windows, vehicle capacity and precedent  constraints while maximizing the total profit. In the case of our study, a carrier has two types of requests to serve: reserved requests and selective requests. All reserved requests must be served due to its commitment to customers. Contrarily, selective requests are optional to serve.  Each request is associated with a pickup and a delivery location and a specific service price.\r\nThe PDPTWPR is NP-hard because the NP-hard PDPTW is its special case. Facing the high complexity of the PDPTWPR, we develop an Iterated Local Search (ILS) heuristic algorithm for this problem.  The ILS is based on a rich neighborhood structure with 6 local search moves tailored to this problem: two intra-route moves (coupe-relocate and coupe-exchange), two inter-route moves (coupe-relocate and coupe-exchange), and a pair of remove/insertion operators of selective requests. These moves or operators are specifically designed to adapt the characteristics of the PDPTWPR.\r\nTo evaluate to the performance of the ILS algorithm, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for the PDPTWPR. The solution found by the ILS is compared with the best solution of the model obtained by the Cplex solver in a given running time. The computational results show that the ILS outperforms the Cplex solver not only in terms of solution quality but also in terms of computational time.\r\n", :title "An Iterated Local Search Algorithm for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows, Profits, and Reserved Requests", :keyword2 37, :authors (46001 15192 19703), :session 25}, 119 {:keyword1 37, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In Turkey, eight years primary education is obligatory[1].

At the start of a round trip, the carrier consolidates orders from a single origin for the long-haul and delivers them to multiple last-mile locations within a fixed destination area. Within this destination area, the carrier also picks up orders from various locations and consolidates them for the long-haul back to the origin. Since the long-hauls are always traveled, the locations that need to be visited for delivery and pickup determine the costs of each trip. Orders have time-windows within which the carrier must transport them to, or from, their locations. Orders become known gradually over time. However, there is probabilistic knowledge about future orders. Using this knowledge, the carrier can select, for each trip, the combination of orders which reduces costs over time (i.e., future trips). Orders are selected using a look-ahead consolidation policy, that is determined using an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach. This policy dictates which set of orders to transport in the next round trip, to minimize present and future (i.e., expected) costs. The approach is usable for different costs functions (i.e., cost as a function of chosen and not chosen orders) and for different transportation constraints. We test our approach in a series of simulation experiments based on data from a Dutch intermodal carrier. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our approach under different scenarios, and provide important managerial insights about consolidation of orders in long-haul round trips.", :title "Dynamic freight selection for reducing long-haul round trip costs", :keyword2 50, :authors (46235 46236), :session 26}, 123 {:keyword1 50, :keyword3 34, :abstract "Organizations providing home care services are inclined to optimize their activities in order to meet the constantly increasing demand for home care. In this context, home care providers are confronted with multiple, often conflicting, objectives such as minimizing their operating costs while maximizing the service level offered to their clients by taking into account their preferences. This paper sheds some light on the trade-off relationship between these two objectives by modeling the home care routing and scheduling problem as a bi-objective problem. The proposed model accounts for qualifications, working regulations and overtime costs of the nurses, travel costs depending on the mode of transportation, hard time windows, and client preferences on visit times and nurses. A distinguishing characteristic of the problem is that the scheduling problem for a single route is a bi-objective problem in itself, thereby complicating the problem considerably. A metaheuristic algorithm, embedding a Large Neighborhood Search heuristic in a Multi-Directional Local Search framework, is proposed to the solve the problem. Computational experiments on a set of benchmark instances based on real-life data are presented. A comparison with exact solutions on small instances shows that the algorithm performs well. An analysis of the results reveals that service providers face a considerable trade-off between costs and client convenience.

Such platforms have to simulate, in detail, not only the dynamically changing demand and supply of the relevant service, but also traffic flow and other relevant transport services.\r\nTo address the problem above, the DVRP extension has been developed for the open-source MATSim simulator. The extension is designed to be highly general and customizable to simulate a wide range of dynamic rich vehicle routing problems. The model is capable of representing one-to-many and many-to-many topologies with nonhomogeneous vehicles, multiple depots, time widows, network-based routing and time-dependent stochastic travel times/costs.

The algorithm reacts to selected events, such as request submissions or vehicle arrivals. Additionally, it can monitor the movement of individual vehicles or query other sources of online information. In response to changes in the system, the optimizer may re-optimize routes. Drivers adjust to the new routes as soon as possible, including immediate vehicle diversion if necessary. For passenger transport, interactions between drivers, passengers and dispatchers are simulated in detail.\r\nThe DVRP extension has been used in several research projects carried out by teams from different universities and research centres.

On the operational planning level, the bike sharing operator relocates bikes in trucks from full to empty stations based on target fill levels. Neglecting relocation operations in service network design will lead to suboptimal fill level decisions. Thus, relocation operations have to be anticipated in service network design.\r\nRelocation operations are usually modeled as computationally challenging vehicle routing problems deciding on relocation services (pickup and return station, time period, number of relocated bikes) as well as their assignment to vehicles and sequencing in tours.

The task of a LTL terminal is the accurate and in time handling of shipments between vehicles on short-distance traffic and transport vehicles on long-distance traffic. The performance of a LTL terminal is largely determined by the proper use of the gates. A gate assignment plan should minimize the waiting times of the trucks while having short transportation distances inside the terminal. However, many uncertain factors influence the planning. Fluctuations can occur in both, the arrival times of vehicles as well as changes in the transported goods. Thus it is reasonable to use stochastic optimization to create a gate assignment plan which can handle the occurring uncertainties.

In the present paper, one particular case is introduced in which a small fixed fleet of container barges needs to be routed on inland waterways. In contrast to the Liner Shipping problem, barges do not sail on a fixed schedule. Instead, a schedule is composed by considering the pickup and delivery intervals of all incoming orders within the planning horizon. Containers can be stacked in two or three layers, while the number of layers and the total container weight determine the barge’s draft and thus the possibility to sail beneath bridges. Exchanging barges between towboats enables variability in barge capacity and therefore assists in generating cost-efficient routes. Additionally, the operator’s inland location imposes extra constraints concerning lock waiting times and varying travel times. The operator’s main goal is to offer high quality services with competitive costs in comparison with truck haulage. When the fleet capacity is insufficient for delivering all orders within the planning horizon, alternative means of transportation (i.e. truck haulage, leasing an extra barge) are necessary. However, these are more costly and are penalized accordingly. Real world data was provided by the container transportation company BCTN Meerhout. We present a heuristic approach to this problem.

Drawbacks are traffic jams and environmental pollution, e.g., noise and carbon dioxide emmision. One approach to tackle these drawbacks is the use of bike sharing systems (BSS). In BSS, users rent and return bikes spontaneously at certain stations. Since mobility demands depend on the location and time, some stations tend to run out of bikes or may congest. To ensure that customers are able to use the service anytime, bikes have to be relocated. The relocations are realized by vehicles moving between stations to pickup and deliver bikes.\r\nIn our article, we analize an exemplary problem that combines inventory and routing challenges. We regard a number of stations. Each station has a certain fill-level. To anticipate future demands, target fill-levels are provided by a tactical information system. Thus, we can identify overruns and shortages of bikes. The challenge is to balance the system with a fleet of capacity restricted vehicles.\r\nWe propose a cluster-first-route-second approach. One main focus is to find suitable clusters. This can be done via variable neighborhood search by metaheuristics. For each cluster, an inventory routing algorithm generates a reallocation tour realizing target intervals. To evaluate our approache, we use real-world data from Vienna's BSS \"CityBike\".

This approach gives rise to additional issues.\r\nFirst, there is the multi-objective character of the problem. Besides the total distance minimization, also the time window violations should be minimized. Contrary to the distance traveled, which is shared by the entire coalition, the time window violations may be different for every collaborating partner. For a coalition of N partners, the problem should therefore be solved for N+1 objectives. To achieve this, a multi-directional variable neighborhood search, which solves this problem without ranking or weighing the objectives in advance,  is developed by the authors.

A major challenge is to support a variety of problems within one framework while remaining competitive with specialized algorithms.\r\nWe study the performance of the implemented methods and their contribution to finding good solutions on basis of three sets of problems with different application background. The first set considers the combined pickup and delivery of finished vehicles, the second set is focused on finished vehicle delivery with varying dealership opening hours, the third set is concerned with assigning incoming trucks to multiple gates on a logistics yard.\r\n", :title "Evaluation of Solution Methods for Single Vehicle Routing Problems", :keyword2 37, :authors (13059), :session 23}, 193 {:keyword1 50, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We introduce a new optimization problem, combining the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) with a heterogeneous fleet and a restricted accessibility of the customer locations, the so-called Site-Dependencies.

Different from deploying school buses to transport general education pupils at certain prescribed bus-stops, special education pupils (SEP, e.g. with disabilities) usually need to be transported door-to-door from home to school by taxis. The SEP usually travels a much longer distance to one of the few schools of their needs, and may require special designed space on the taxi for different types of wheelchairs. There exist ca. a hundred types of taxis differing in price (basic price + cost per km), passenger capacity from 2 to 28 persons, and wheelchair capacity from 0 to 4. Each taxi can be simultaneously shared by multiple pupils, and even pupils from different schools. Each pupil should arrive at their school 5 to 15 minutes before their class starts, and the journey should not exceed their maximum tolerable driving time. The objective is to save cost (thus tax money), while reducing emissions.\r\nThis problem can be regarded as an extension of Heterogeneous VRP with pickup and delivery and coupled time windows, and can be modelled as a multi-commodity flow problem either in a time-expanded network or using the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation. However, the resulting MILP models can be solved to proven optimality by commercial solvers (e.g. CPLEX, Gurobi) only up to 10 pupils and 3 schools. To tackle this problem, a parameterized greedy (PGreedy) metaheuristic is developed, which applies a parameterized greedy criterion for node insertion, and the greedy parameters are automatically adapted during the algorithm run. PGreedy is tested on real-world instances up to 696 pupils and 53 schools. It has improved a current manual schedule by ca. 20%, and has also outperformed a commercial software with a genetic algorithm implementation specially designed for this task. Initializing commercial MILP solvers by the PGreedy solution further improves the best-found solution as well as the lower bound.", :title "School Taxi Routing for Special Education Pupils in Germany", :keyword2 37, :authors (45357 16315 42967), :session 23}, 240 {:keyword1 37, :keyword3 15, :abstract "We consider the problem of designing a comprehensive plan for inbound logistics that faces a third-party logistics provider.

Such areas can be found in various medium and large cities, e.g., Malaga, Bologna, Milan and Paris. By restricting the use of fossil fuelled engines, the use of limited battery electric engines is encouraged, which reduces the local emissions of carbon dioxide considerably. However, this might lead to increased costs in form of detours or additional vehicles required due to additional, time consuming recharging operations. Furthermore, special care has to be taken in the operational evaluation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, where the driver can switch between the fossil fuelled and electric engine on route.\r\n\r\nTo study the impact of city centers, we conducted experiment on generated artificial benchmark instances based on well-known problem instances for related problems and instances based on real world street maps.

Each client has a strictly positive demand. In the simplest problem variant a vehicle's state of charge (SOC) is fully recovered when visiting a charging station. A network arc is defined by its travel cost, the energy consumed by an empty vehicle, and the additional energy when carrying a single load unit. Based on these values the total consumed energy on this arc depending on the current vehicle's load can be derived. These energy values can be negative if the vehicle is able to recover energy on a downward slope. The fleet is homogeneous with fixed load and SOC limits.\r\nThe objective is to find a set of routes with minimal total costs such that each route starts and ends at the depot, each client is visited exactly once, the total demand of all clients on a route must not exceed the load capacity, and the SOC stays within its limits.

The MPDPSL is defined as “one-to-one” since each product has a pre-assigned pickup and delivery location. The objective is to find minimum distance routes using at most all available vehicles, respecting  capacity and maximum driving distance per vehicle, as well as precedence between pickups and deliveries. A customer may also be serviced by several vehicles, each one taking one part of the product. The MPDPSL is NP-hard and commonly found in practice, for example in parcel delivery services or car hauling applications. Combining pickups and deliveries with split loads leads to a difficult problem, even for neighborhood-centered heuristics, due to the large variety of possible service modes for each product. As a consequence few methods are available to address this problem.\r\n\r\nTo face this challenge, we propose a hybrid heuristic based on random variable neighborhood descent. The method relies on various local-search neighborhoods to cover all problem characteristics, combining changes of pickup locations, delivery locations, and load-splitting decisions. Larger neighborhoods are also considered, by reducing the problem of finding the best combination of pickup and deliveries with split loads -- for one product -- to a resource-constrained shortest path and solving it by dynamic programming.

This problem, with fixed routes, arises when enumerating solutions (or solution subspaces) of a vehicle routing problem for lateral transhipments with piecewise linear profits, during heuristic resolution.
