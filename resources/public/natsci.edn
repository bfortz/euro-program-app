Important particular example of continuous time Markov chain is so called birth and death process. The generator of a birth and death process is a three-diagonal matrix. From the early beginning, birth and death processes were applied for modelling the size of population of insects (this expains the name of such processes) in various biological studies. Currently, they are popular for modelling social systems (immigration and emigration), demography, ecology, genetics, molecular evolution, queue lengths in many physical, technical, economical and other systems. Evident shortcoming of application of a birth and death process to description of some population is an assumption that, during his/her life, each member of population can die or give a life to a child at a constant rate. Sure, in real life systems the birth and death rates essentially depend on the sex and age of the members of population. So, to have a more adequate model of dynamics of population, it is necessary to keep additionally track of this information about the sex and age. In such a way, the dynamics of population is described not only by its size (it is called sometimes as a level of a process), but also by the final set of some additional features. Thus, the process describing the dynamics of population is a multi-dimensional one. Under some proper enumeration of the components of this process, its generator has a three-block-diagonal structure. Such process is called in literature as quasi-birth-and-death process. The theory of quasi-birth-and-death processes with Toeplitz-like type structure of a generator and its generalizations to the cases of block-upper-Hessenberg and block-lower-Hessenberg Toeplitz-like structure of generator was developed by M. Neuts.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, well-known results by M. Neuts are shortly described and the original results relating to investigation of two particular structures of a generator of Markov chain are presented. One structure is block-upper-Hessenbergian with approaching to Toeplitz-like type when the level increases. Markov chains having such a structure of generator well fit for description of real world processes with the birth and death rates proportional to the number of a level, e.g., for description of queues with customers retrial and queues with impartient customers. The second structure is a combination of block-upper-Hessenberg Toeplitz-like structure and structure with equal block rows of a generator. Such Markov chains are suitable, e.g., for description of queueing systems with exhaustive group service or with disasters. Ergodicity conditions are presented. Numerically stable algorithms for computation of stationary distribution are derived.\r\n\r\nLiterature:\r\n\r\n1. F.W.

This is often the case in chemistry and the geosciences.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence analysis (CA), popular in the social and environmental sciences, is concerned with analysing data tables of counts, but also \"relativizes\" the data by considering the counts relative to the row and column sums of the table -- these relativized rows (or columns) are called profiles, also with non-negative values adding up to 1 - thus,  correspondence analysis is also a method of compositional data analysis.\r\n\r\nThanks to the work of John Aitchison (1986) there developed a CoDa school \r\nbased on the log-ratio transformation of the data.  This transformation also relativizes the values in compositional data set, but not relative to the margins, but rather by looking at all the pairwise ratios, on a logarithmic scale.  A principal component analysis type approach to CoDa was developed, summarized by Aitchison and Greenacre (2002). \r\n\r\nThese two approaches to analysing similar data sets, CoDa and CA, were \r\nunified by Greenacre (2009), who showed that they were members of the \r\nsame family of methods, thanks to the Box-Cox transformation on data ratios, which converges to the log-transformation. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will explain this interesting log-ratio connection, demonstrate the implications for data analysis and emphasize how the connection with CA inspires the idea of weighting the components in CoDa.

Apart from the aesthetic\r\nsurgery, it also includes many types of the reconstructive surgery. Many of these operations imply massive interventions and need careful preparation and planning. The computational simulation of plastic surgery, that is, the development and use of mathematical models for preoperative planning as well as for postoperative evaluation is becoming quite usual. The most challenging problem in surgery computer simulation is the modelling of soft tissue behaviour, as well as of the knitting conditions. From the mathematical point of view, soft tissue deformation is described by a map from the original domain to its deformed counterpart. Soft tissue can be modelled as a hyper-elastic material, that is, a material satisfying the standard thermodynamic axiom of non-negative works in closed processes. In this model, the deformation is a minimizer of the stored energy functional. Consequently, calculus of variations turns out to be a natural tool to describe the soft tissue deformations. General Variational Problem of Plastic Surgery, introduced not long ago, is a problem of calculus of variations with unusual boundary conditions, known as knitting conditions. These conditions model suturing and are fundamental for surgery simulations. In this talk we discuss variational methods in plastic surgery modelling. The main problems addressed are the existence of solutions for problems of calculus of variations with knitting boundary conditions, necessary conditions of optimality, approximation of solutions, numerical methods for the knitting problem, and the optimization problema of data fitting in the framework of parameter estimation.", :title "Variational Problems of Plastic Surgery", :keyword2 0, :authors (40321), :session 37}, 111 {:keyword1 164, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This talk concerns a simple model of bicycle motion: a bicycle is a segment of fixed length that can move in the plane so that the velocity of the rear end is always aligned with the segment.

This circle mapping is a Moebius transformation, a remarkable fact that has various geometrical and dynamical consequences.\r\nMoebius transformations belong to one of the three types: elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. I shall outline a proof of a 100 years old conjecture: if the front wheel track is an oval with area at least Pi then the respective monodromy is hyperbolic.\r\n\r\nThe rear wheel track and a choice of direction determine the front wheel\r\ntrack; changing the direction to the opposite, yields another front track.

It is supposed that the objective function can be “black box”, multiextremal, and non-differentiable. It is also assumed that evaluation of the objective function at a point is a time-consuming operation. Many algorithms for solving this problem have been discussed in literature. They can be distinguished, for example, by the way of obtaining information about the Lipschitz constant and by the strategy of exploration of the search domain. \r\n\r\nDifferent exploration techniques based on various adaptive partition strategies are analyzed. The main attention  is  dedicated to  diagonal  algorithms,   since they   have a number   of  attractive  theoretical properties and have proved to be efficient in solving applied problems. In these algorithms, the search hyperinterval   is   adaptively   partitioned   into   smaller hyperintervals   and   the   objective   function   is evaluated only at two vertices corresponding to the main diagonal of the generated hyperintervals.\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrated that the traditional diagonal partition strategies do not fulfil the requirements of computational efficiency because of executing many redundant evaluations of the objective function. A new adaptive diagonal partition strategy that allows one to avoid such computational redundancy is described. Some powerful multidimensional global optimization algorithms based on the new strategy are introduced. Results of extensive numerical experiments performed to test the methods proposed demonstrate their advantages with respect to diagonal algorithms in terms of both number of trials of the objective function and qualitative analysis of the search domain, which is characterized by the number of generated hyperintervals.\r\n\r\nSelected references\r\n\r\n1.

The new approach is based on the principle ‘The part is less than the whole’ introduced by Ancient Greeks that is applied to all numbers (finite, infinite, and infinitesimal) and to all sets and processes (finite and infinite). It is shown that it becomes possible to write down finite, infinite, and infinitesimal numbers by a finite number of symbols as particular cases of a unique framework different from that of the non-standard analysis.  The new methodology (see surveys [6,10]) evolves ideas of Cantor and Levi-Civita in a more applied way and introduces new infinite integers that possess both cardinal and ordinal properties as usual finite numbers (its relations with traditional approaches are discussed in [11,16]). It gives the possibility to execute computations of a new type and simplifies fields of mathematics where the usage of the infinity and/or infinitesimals is necessary (e.g., divergent series, limits, derivatives, integrals, measure theory, probability theory, fractals, etc., see [3-24]). Numerous examples and applications are given. A number of results related to the First Hilbert Problem are established.In the following  there are listed  both  operations that the Infinity  Computer  can execute  and traditional computers are not able to perform and some of new areas of applications. The new approach allows:\r\n\r\n• to substitute symbols +∞ and -∞ by sets of positive and negative infinite numbers, to represent   them   in   the   memory   of   the   Infinity   Computer   and   to   execute   arithmetical operations with all of them numerically, as we are used to do with usual finite numbers on traditional computers;\r\n\r\n• to   substitute   qualitative   descriptions   of   the   type   ‘a   number   tends   to   zero’   by   precise infinitesimal numbers, to represent them in the memory of the Infinity Computer, and to execute arithmetical operations with them numerically as we are used to do with usual finite numbers using traditional computers;\r\n\r\n• to calculate divergent limits, series, and improper integrals, providing as results explicitly written different infinite numbers, to be possibly used in further calculations on the Infinity Computer;\r\n\r\n• to avoid appearance of indeterminate forms (e.g., in situations where it becomes necessary to calculate difference of two divergent series);\r\n\r\n• to evaluate functions and their derivatives at infinitesimal, finite, and infinite points (infinite and infinitesimal values of functions and their derivatives can be also explicitly calculated);\r\n\r\n• to study divergent processes at different infinite points;\r\n\r\n• to introduce notions of lengths, areas, and volumes of fractal objects obtained after infinite numbers of steps and compatible with traditional lengths, areas, and volumes of non-fractal objects and to calculate all of them in a unique framework. \r\n\r\nThe   Infinity   Calculator   using   the   Infinity   Computer   technology   is   presented   during   the   talk.
