Stochastic optimization problems with non time-consistent functionals as objective may lead to the following situation: From the standpoint of today (time 0), a certain decision strategy x is optimal for the future decision at time 1, while this decision has to be revised if actually time 1 is reached and this fact is already known at time 0.\r\n\r\nHowever, time-consistent functionals are typically not information-monotone, while information-monotone functionals are typically not time-consistent, because the intersection between the two properties is rather small. In general, one has to decide which property of a multi-period risk functional is the desired one and give up the other property. We give some theory and demonstrate the problem with some examples.

The number of unknown parameters (m) can increase if the number of observations (N) growing up. At each point there is only one observation, which does not allow to estimate unknown variances. Such models are new and typical for applications, because for statistical data analysis first step is data approximation by function with unknown parameters. For accurate approximation, the number of unknown parameters can increase when number of observations goes up. Such models are widely used in finance, insurance and other applications. \r\n\tMain aim:\r\n-\twithout estimation of error variances to estimate the elements of the covariance matrix of the vector sqrt(N(Q*-Q)) where Q is the vector of unknown parameters, Q* is the least square estimator (l.s.e.).\r\n-\tconstruct a confidence band for the unknown function in regression models.\r\nNumerical examples, demonstrating results and advantage of that method in comparison with known approaches will be given.\r\n\r\nSecond part of the paper is related to control problems by queues. \r\nLet us assume t1,t2,…,tn is a sequence when service starts in the system. An arbitrary and stationary flow of customers arrive for service. In the capacity of an efficiency index is taken customer average waiting time before service, which is defined as a time interval from instant of customer arrival into the system until the next ti. At the each instant ti all customers, arrived at the interval [t(i-1),ti) immediately get service, i.e. service time is equal to zero. For reducing the efficiency index the delay of beginning service is introduced. As a matter of such control the intervals between neighbour services will be increased. It is shown that such control can improve service, i.e. diminish (sometimes for 10%) customer waiting time before service. (PARADOX!)  \r\nThe class of systems for which it is advisable to introduce delay has described. The optimal function minimizing the efficiency index has found.
