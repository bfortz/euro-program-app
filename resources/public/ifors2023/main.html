<h2>Information</h3>
<p><strong>Venues:</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget that the conference will take place at two different
venues, located within walking distance from each other. The schedule
has, however, been designed to reduce moving from one place to the
other. The two venues are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “Centro de Extensión” of Pontifical Catholic University of
Chile. In what follows we refer to this venue as “<strong>CE</strong>”
and to Catholic University as PUC.</p></li>
<li><p>The School of Business of the University of Chile. In what
follows we refer to this venue as “<strong>FEN</strong>” and to the
University of Chile as UChile.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conference check-in:</strong></p>
<p>Will be located at Centro de Extensión (CE) and will begin on Sunday
at 14:00 and will remain open Monday to Thursday from 8:00 to 17:00 and

<p><strong>Exhibit Hall</strong></p>

will be open from Monday to Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee and lunch:</strong></p>
<p>At lunchtime on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, we will

and the login instructions will be available at check in. Complimentary
Wi-Fi is available at the venues, which will also work for those who
