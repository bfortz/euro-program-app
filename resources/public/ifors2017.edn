It combines the strong features of the MOO and SOO methods to provide the efficient and fast update of the routes and can be used online by the crew with the full control over the choice of the compromise routes. Firstly, the MOO problem corresponding to the initial weather forecast is solved using the Dynamic Programming and one or several Pareto optimal solutions are selected by the user. Each of these reference solutions transforms into a single-objective optimization criteria. Such SOOP are introduced to reflect the chosen reference solutions. These new problems are solved each time a new weather forecast or other data are available. For large changes in weather conditions the SOOP may become infeasible with respect to some constraints, e.g. fuel consumption. In this case the optimal routes are recalculated as the new weather forecast is available. To speedup computations, parallel computations are used. The numerical experiment with 596 Pareto optimal solutions on the final stage obtained by the MOOP gives CPU time equal to 5 hours. Solution of the correspondent SOOP takes 9.4 min with as good solution.

In order to achieve delay-based service differentiation over multiple job classes, we propose an alternative family of controls that exploit the head-of-line delay information. This new family, which we refer to as head-of-line-delay-ratio (HLDR) control, extends the so-called accumulating priority rule in the literature and achieves desired differentiated service in an appropriate many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime. Our analysis has two interesting implications: (i) a fixed queue ratio (QR) and fixed HLDR can not be maintained at the same time in heavy traffic in the presence of time-varying arrival rates; (ii) for each HLDR control, there exits QR-type control such that these two controls are asymptotically equivalent.", :title "Achieving service-level differentiation in a time-varying queue network", :keyword2 104, :authors (53078), :session 458}, 54 {:keyword1 65, :keyword3 29, :abstract "A financial portfolio decision process with value-at-risks is discussed, and the risk criterion is composed by unexpected short-term risks which occur suddenly in each period.

During the emergency response to mass casualty incidents decisions relating to the extrication, transporting and treatment of casualties are made in a sequential manner. In this paper, the stochastic nature of casualty health and treatment time are considered to determine ambulance dispatches assignment. We assume the uncertainty follows “Markov chain” properties in which the correlations of the variations in the consecutive periods are high and the severity status of casualties in next period is stochastically determined by the present one. A novel stochastic dynamic programming model is proposed and can help avoid myopic decision making of the response operation which could result from the use of a sequential, heuristic decision making process. The total response times of casualties at the different levels of injury severity, including waiting times at emergency sites and hospitals, transportation times, and treatment times, are minimized. We utilize a lexicographic view to combine these objectives in a manner which capitalizes on their ordering of priority. That is, injuries of higher level of severity have higher priority. Furthermore, a simulation-based approximate dynamic programming algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model.

We show that differences between the decision makers’ priority policies are all about classification. Both are content to offer very coarse schemes with just two priority levels, and they will have negligible differences in coverage. However, differences in classification are persistent. A revenue maximizer may - relative to the social planner - have too few or too many high priority customers. Whether the revenue maximizer over- or under-stuffs the high priority class depends on a measure of consumer surplus that is captured by the mean residual life function of the valuation distribution.

The objective aimed to achieve is to maximize in-sequence movements and minimize backtracking movements. An example is given to illustrate the proposed layout procedure and compares it with the layout results obtained by other existing layout approaches.

The study of local search for TSP continues to be an interesting problem in combinatorial optimization and computational mathematics. We study local search for the TSP from the perspective of dynamical systems and treat a local search system as a discrete dynamical system. The attractor theory in dynamical systems provides the necessary and sufficient theoretical foundation to study the search behavior of local search system. In a local search system, all search trajectories converge into a small region of the solution space, called solution attractor. We will describe a procedure for constructing solution attractor of a local search system for TSP. This procedure can be used to build an attractor-based search system to solve the TSP and its variations. The benefits of the attractor-based search system include (1) the search result is guaranteed to be optimal, and (2) all best solutions can be found if the TSP instance is multimodal. We will also present our empirical study on some important properties of the solution attractor, including convergence of local search trajectories, the size of the solution attractor, and quality of the tours in the solution attractor.

Since full-field implicit simulations are prohibitively costly, reservoir management policies are typically developed with standalone reservoir models, while constraints with respect to the production gathering network are limited or fully disregarded. However, it is well known that the field operation is driven by platform settings and constraints imposed by the network and processing facilities. Therefore, the disregard of such constraints may render unfeasible operational plans in practice, precluding their application in real-world fields. In this work, we propose to optimize oil reservoirs constrained by gathering networks with a multiple shooting formulation, which is a control method suitable for problems with numerous output constraints. This method splits the prediction horizon of the optimal control problem in several smaller intervals enabling the use of decomposition and parallelization techniques. The developed methodology is assessed in a two-phase black-oil reservoir producing to a gathering network with nonlinear constraints regarding the operation of electrical submersible pumps.

For welfare-maximizing government agencies, the subsidy policy offers greater incentives for the manufacturer to abate pollution and yields higher profits for channel members. However, when pollution abatement is very costly and production emissions are highly damaging, the tax policy should be implemented as the subsidy policy leads to lower social welfare and environmental performance. Furthermore, Caution should be exercised when implementing the subsidy policy as a “hazard zone” exists where the society suffers, which does not exist under the tax policy. For manufacturers, interestingly, improving pollution abatement efficiency does not always payoff even it is costless. The aforementioned results are robust to market competition. Also, the manufacturer always welcomes competition under the subsidy policy, but not necessary under the tax policy; each retailer always fares worse with competition. Finally, competition enhances social welfare under the tax policy, but cautions should be taken if the government intends to encourage competition under a subsidy policy. ", :title "Tax or subsidy?

Some successful cases in transportation have been reported in literature, but have occurred over limited ranges of time. Until now, the OR models used to study the horizontal collaboration in transportation have not included competition between firms: contracts are signed, and both quantities and prices are fixed. Without competition, agreements always save on costs and it is then a matter of allocating costs savings wisely. In our model we consider a coalition formation game but prior to market equilibrium; that is, we propose a collaborative model in which, after the agreements are signed, the different firms and coalitions compete in multiple markets in Cournot fashion. When this happens, the formation of one set of coalitions affect prices and production levels of all other competitors, something that did not occur in the previous literature. Possible partnership among these firms are allowed and studied. One main result is that, as opposed to what has been found in the literature to date, forming coalitions that are beneficial to firms in the agreement is actually quite hard, which would explain why collaboration has not been observed as much as expected.

This real-world problem, found in manufacturing processes of cast rolling mill rolls, has the particularity that pairs of tasks must be completed at the same time. The manufacturing process uses induction heating furnaces of different sizes and melting rates. So, not all rolls can be produced in any furnace and the processing time for each roll depends on which furnace it will be produced. Due to the characteristics of furnace operation and also the different types of materials used, one roll can take advantage of the residue left in the furnace by the immediately preceding produced roll. So, the processing time also depends on the order in which the rolls are produced. Besides, some rolls are made of two different materials, which need to be ready at the same time. This synchronization constraint makes the problem even more complex and adds the possibility of reaching infeasible solutions.

When supply and demand are not aligned, a loyalty program would work as a supply adjustment policy without suppressing the demand. Technically, we model matching in space through Stackelberg game, and establish dynamic equations governing the evaluation of conditional spatial-distributions of supply and demand. By making distinctions between steady-state and supply-demand equilibrium, and further characterizing the conditions to achieve them, we are able to analyze theoretically how incentives influence the evolution of this tri-party interacting system. What we find is that for a given number of available drivers in the system, how much \"additional\" supply could be created is capped by the maximum matching ratio, achieved at the optimal amount of incentives. Beyond that amount, matching ratio will decline.

The idea of retiming is that scheduling flexibility is increased, such that previously inevitable cancellations can be avoided. To incorporate delays, we expand the underlying recovery network with retiming possibilities. This leads to a problem formulation that can be solved using Lagrangian relaxation. As the network gets too large, we propose an iterative neighborhood exploration heuristic to solve the VRSPRT. This heuristic allows retiming for a subset of trips, and adds promising trips to this subset as the algorithm continues. Computational results indicate that the heuristic performs well. While requiring acceptable additional computation time, the iterative heuristic finds improvement over solutions that do not allow retiming in one third of the tested instances.

Unfortunately, for analytical tractability, most existing theoretical analysis has assumed a model in which the replicas of a job each experience independent runtimes (service times) at different servers. This model is unrealistic and has led to theoretical results which can be at odds with computer systems implementation results. We introduce a much more realistic model of redundancy.

We analyze its convergence rates in the case of convex and non convex objectives, respectively. Importantly, the DeFW algorithm applies a dynamic network consensus technique such that the perturbed iterates track their unperturbed counterparts with increasing accuracies over the iteration number, while requiring a constant number of communication rounds per iteration. This also allows us to perform asynchronous distributed optimization in a projection free manner.

We estimate the default risk of a firm by employing the structural credit risk model first developed by Merton (1974). Using the model, we explain the theoretical linkage between CSP and the probability of default (PD). We find that CSP is positively associated with the PD of financially unconstrained large-capital firms. However, PD among those large-capital firms is extremely low, and CSP exerts little influence over default risk. Among small-capital firms, by contrast, CSP is negatively associated with PD. This implies that a higher degree of CSP alleviates the default risk of small-capital firms. These asymmetric CSP effects on PD can be explained by the difference in risk and profit reduction between large and small-capital firms. Financially constrained small-capital firms can reduce their PD and cost of debt by improving their CSP, although their CSR activities are detrimental to the profitability of the firm. Thus, managers of financially unconstrained small-capital firms should pay more attention to CSR activities to enhance trustworthiness in the capital market by mitigating social risk.", :title "Effects of corporate social performance on default risk: Structural model-based analysis on Japanese firms ", :keyword2 101, :authors (4049), :session 489}, 374 {:keyword1 44, :keyword3 93, :abstract "Emergency department (ED) crowding has become a serious concern worldwide.

A more effective method of physician scheduling is a procedure to achieve an overall balance between physicians' productivity and patient arrivals.

Computational results show that no consideration of breaks leads to a significant underestimation of the required workforce size and with this to an increase in staff utilization as well as resulting working hours in terms of overtime, especially under real life assumptions.

Transport requests are reallocated between carriers via an auction organized by a central, neutral institution. The mechanism is composed by four major processes: Request Selection, Bundle Generation, Bid Generation and Winner Determination. Bidders select which requests to send to the auctioneer. The auctioneer groups complementary requests into attractive bundles to be offered to all the carriers in the network. Carriers then bid on each of these bundles, and finally, the auctioneer solves the Winner Determination problem by assigning bundles to carriers minimizing the total cost to be paid. Calculating exact costs for each bundle would involve prohibitive computational costs of solving a large number of VRP's. We therefore propose a regression-based approximation for bundle evaluation.

These fixed models generally ignore two important aspects: first, the possibility to reevaluate the decision to overhaul or replace in a given period, not taking into account the flexibility in the decisions and second, the uncertainty of economic factors, such as price, which can affect future maintenance decisions. This work contributes by taking into account the effect of integrated price uncertainty in joint overhaul and replacement strategy definition using a real option approach and a mean reversion binomial model for the uncertainty in the price. To achieve this objective, we develop a real option model and determine an optimal intervention policy which maximize the expected profit.

Firstly, we have developed a linear programming model with which we can estimate the most important emission factors attributable to diet in intensive animal production. Secondly, this model has been applied to Spanish livestock analysing the solution sensitivity to the model coefficients.\r\n", :title "An aggregate linear programming model to estimate the pollutant and greenhouse gases emissions from livestock ", :keyword2 59, :authors (783 31644 25385 19630), :session 116}, 482 {:keyword1 90, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We consider the maximum k-cut problem that consists in partitioning the vertex set of a graph into k subsets such that the sum of the weights of edges joining vertices in different subsets is maximized.

This assignment ensures that the handling of each vessel can be done without disruptions, thus producing solutions that can be applied in practice. We have also developed an iterative procedure for the BACASP.

While Dantzig's classical pivot rule accurately measures the improvement rate of the objective function, the influence on the affected basic variables is taken for granted for every non-basic variable unit change. When one ultimately realizes that not all affected basic variables can be modified, it becomes clear that the pricing rule suffers from a visibility problem in terms of the basic variable space. When trying to avoid primal infeasible directions, one should consider pivot-selection (or pricing) rules that are guided by dual optimality instead. From the dual perspective, one maximizes the minimum reduced cost that can be achieved upon dividing the set of dual variables in two subsets: one being fixed while the other is optimized. From the primal perspective, one selects a nonnegative combination of variables entering the basis. The direction is uniquely completed by identifying the affected basic variables, if any.

In many countries, Defence consumes a sizeable portion of national budget. Fiscal pressures affect funding allocation to Defence capabilities, a process often occurring in a Defence Committee. One impediment to optimum investment decisions is widely-recognised interservice rivalry (e.g. where Navy, Army and Air Force compete).

Results can include inefficient investment and compromised national interest. Repeated waves of Government reform targeting Defence (to achieve efficiencies or improved ‘jointery’) are symptomatic of this unresolved principal-agent problem.

Each job has to go through each machine in the same order. The distributed extension models a real situation which appears in larger companies which operate many production facilities. With this consideration there is an additional decision dimension so as to which factory each job should be assigned to. As a result, in the distributed permutation flowshop problem there are f factories and one has to first decide the job to factory assignment and then to schedule all jobs at each factory.

We reveal that although flexible and inflexible firms are of different capacity strategies, they follow the same mechanism in determining capacity investment decisions. We have found under certainty conditions, an increasing competition intensity of inflexible (flexible) firms damages the flexible firms’ affordability of capacity investment and force the flexible (inflexible) firms to quit the market.

Using a sample retail channel and a panel of households between 2007 and 2009, we find that the consumption rates of both stockpiler and non-stockpiler segments decrease when the economy contracts. Further, consumers are more likely to behave as stockpilers during contraction periods than during expansion periods. From a managerial perspective, these changing patterns of consumer stockpiling behavior introduce challenges to retail inventory management. As the economy contracts, promotional inventory has to be corrected downwards to capture decreases in overall demand, but also adjusted upwards to account for higher propensity to stockpile.

A pairing is a crew path starting at a base covering many flights during few days of works and finishing at the same base. For large-scale problems a first difficulty is the exponential number of feasible pairing (number of variables). Columns generation permits to deal with it. However solving a master problem of 50 000 constraints at each of the thousands iterations of the column generation request to much time. To reduce the solution time some airlines use a Rolling-Horizon heuristic (RH) that divides the horizon into overlapping time slices. For example two days slices with an overlap of one day. However solving 30 problems of 3000 flights (two days time slices) requires many days and the quality of solutions in not so good because the optimisation is too myopic (the windows are narrow). The Dynamic Constraints Aggregation method (DCA) developed by (Elhallaoui et al. 2005) speed-up the master problem by reducing the degeneracy. This method also produces better dual variables and reduces the number of column generation iterations. Furthermore the LP solution is less fractional and it reduces the number of nodes to explore in the branch and bound. This permits to solve a weekly window of 10 000 flights in few hours.

This negotiation process involves many uncertainties from the energy producer's side. The demand for biomass is uncertain at the time of negotiation, and heat demand and electricity prices vary drastically during the planning period.

On the other hand, the optimization models that are considered to design and configure a system are associated with (mixed) integer linear problems (MILP).

In this research, we present a general framework that overcomes these limitations and is able to integrate advanced discrete choice models in MILP. Since the formulation has designed to be linear, the price to pay is its high dimension, which results in a computationally expensive problem.

More precisely, Lagrangian decomposition can be applied since there are two subproblems with common variables: one concerning the user and another concerning the operator.

Under certain constraint qualifications (e.g., the well-known Slater constraint qualification) we derive new optimality conditions for such problems.\r\n", :title "Optimality conditions in generalized-convex constrained multi-objective optimization", :keyword2 67, :authors (36786), :session 77}, 666 {:keyword1 41, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In general, many factors and the causal relationships of factors should be considered in a system.

A train operator may have the policy of economically compensating (e.g., refunding ticket fare) passengers when they incur in delays. Compensation levels usually depend in the amount of delay. Therefore, it is important to have a smart way of deciding whether to speed up trains in order to absorb delays, i.e., increasing energy consumption, or to compensate passengers. In this talk a mathematical model which decides on the speed profile while considering passenger use is presented. The model decides on the optimal sequence of operating regimes and the switching points between them for a range of different circumstances and train types all while considering delays and passenger compensation policies applied by the train operator.

Constraints on traction and braking forces, on train velocity, on forces caused by vertical and horizontal track profile, and on passenger compensation policy are considered.

Especially when operated with battery electric vehicles such systems can reduce local emissions, air pollution, and contribute towards a sustainable city. In order to be successful, these systems have to be carefully planned and several strategic decisions have to be made. We consider the planning of a free-floating electric car sharing system regarding the strategic decisions of the operator. Compared to station-based systems, in a free-floating environment the users can rent and return the cars anywhere within the operational area. When using electric cars, however, recharging stations have to be planned. The problem of how many and where to place these stations and the optimal number of cars to be deployed is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The quality assessment of these decisions is performed by simulating users of the system based on a demand and behavior model. The latter is based on a probability model for the user decisions to approximate the expected profit of the system. A major challenge is to find a realistic correlation between incentives and the probability of relocating stranded cars by users or returning the car at a nearby station instead of the actual desired destination.

Depending on the nature of delay-causing effects and the extent of delays, schedules are modified by either delaying some trains or changing their orders. The effectiveness of these scheduling decisions can be attributed to deviations from the schedule (i.e., delays) at points along the rail line, especially at stations and junctions, where actual departure and arrival times are recorded and compared with the corresponding scheduled times. The pairs of consecutive train departure-arrival and arrival-departure constitute events for determining delay propagation along train paths and can be considered as stochastic processes. Defining the certain delay measures as states and tracing the consecutive delays of a train path help the analyst extract delay transition structure leading to the transition matrix for delay propagation. The transition matrices developed in this manner can be used to determine various performance measures in Markov chain models as well as to make predictions for train movements. This novel approach in scheduling is, however, restricted by Markov assumptions. Before utilizing the developed transition matrices, they should be tested for those assumptions, namely, Markov property and time-stationarity or time-homogeneity property.

The resulting blocking job-shop problem is complex due to additional interdependencies of different jobs on different machines. Mathematical programming results give evidence to the necessity of efficient heuristic methods to obtain near-optimal solutions even for small instances.  There are two major challenges in the application of a heuristic approach to this problem. First, a permutation of operations, which does always define a feasible schedule for the classical job-shop problem, is not necessarily giving a feasible schedule with regard to blocking constraints. Second, it is not clear how to complete and repair a partial solution to determine feasible neighbors of a solution. For the blocking job-shop problem a procedure is presented, which generates a feasible schedule from any given permutation of operations. Additionally, a neighborhood is derived applying adjacent pairwise interchanges together with a technique to repair and complete partial solutions and construct feasible neighbors.

None of these approaches account for the disturbance variability which can be huge, particularly in the context of climate change. In the research, we evaluate a base scenario (management strategy) under multiple disturbance scenarios. We used predetermined variable wildfire burn fractions in our linear programming model based on Model III formulation. The variable disturbance by period was generated through sampling from historical burn fraction records. We generated 100 time series of burn fractions and solved the model 100 times then compared results to our base scenario. In this way we can assess the variability of forest management indicators such as harvest volume and area, and levels of silvicultural activities.

It is important to have a lot of information for decision making to deal with such financial problems. An economic evaluation is applied as information for decision making on investment projects. However, in real investment projects, there are many uncertainties about income, costs and economic circumstances. The real option theory is a method that considers the situation with such uncertainties and that gives flexibility than conventional economic evaluation as the net present value method. In this work, we examine an influence of risk averse on investment decisions in a pre-emptive duopolistic market that compete leader’s position by means of the real options theory. We analyze the investment timing of leader for entering the duopolistic market for the cost and the degree of risk aversion by fixing the follower’s threshold. As results of the analysis, under the asymmetric risk aversion, we find that incentives for leaders and followers entering the duopolistic market could increase or decrease. Furthermore, the leader has demerit incentive for investing to entering the market from the influence of the risk aversion and the demand of the market. In the case of analysis with respect to the threshold of the leader with the fixed threshold of the follower, it turns out that the threshold of the leader changes despite of the threshold of the follower is fixed due to the effect of risk aversion.", :title "Investment in an asymmetric duopoly under risk aversion", :keyword2 25, :authors (53931 41444), :session 179}, 861 {:keyword1 104, :keyword3 66, :abstract "A power utility's ability to satisfy energy demand can be influenced significantly by unexpected breakdowns of power generating units (PGUs). In most cases, such unexpected failures are also much more expensive to repair than taking planned preventative maintenance action. Maintenance of ageing PGUs, however, often is neglected due to high energy demand and low system capacity. The typical objectives pursued in the design of PGU maintenance schedules do not take these difficulties into account. Two new scheduling criteria are therefore proposed. The occurrences of PGU failures may be estimated using methods from reliability theory in which the aim is typically to quantify the probability of a system completing its intended function for a specific duration of time. Based on this theory, the first scheduling objective seeks to minimise the probability that any PGUs in the power system will fail during the scheduling window, weighted by the rated power generating capacity of each PGU. An alternative objective is also proposed which seeks to maximise the expected energy produced over the scheduling period, taking into account possible failures of PGUs in the system.  The feasibility and effectiveness of these new objectives are analysed by applying it to well-known PGU maintenance scheduling benchmark systems from the literature.", :title "Generator maintenance scheduling based on the risk of power generating unit failure", :keyword2 98, :authors (50434 6425), :session 696}, 867 {:keyword1 18, :keyword3 103, :abstract "Two variants of multiple Hamiltonian path problem are considered. The general multiple Hamiltonian path problem is to find m paths for m vehicles such that all the destination are visited exactly once and the total cost is minimum.

Many students turn a blind eye to the bullying because they are afraid that they may become the next target. We focus on the behaviour of bystanders. Each bystander makes a decision to report to the teacher about the bullying or to stay silent by both other bystanders’ behaviour and his/her own motivation. Suppose that bullying is resolved when more than the threshold number of students who report the bullying. Bystander makes a decision to report about the bullying to the teacher or to stay silent repeatedly until bullying is resolved. We assume that each bystander makes a decision according to individual satisfactory level instead of completely rational-choice.

Thus, all holes are not the same with respect to scoring. However, one-hole games serve as a basis to obtain a set of good team allocation candidates for the real 18-hole game.

This deterministic \"multi-armed bandit problem\" is formulated as a continuous global optimization problem on an interval. A complete characterization of the set of solutions is obtained in terms of an adjoint variable which measures the available continuation gain. The adjoint variable can be computed as the unique solution of an initial-value problem. For its computation we provide a recursive Picard-type algorithm which usually converges in a finite number of iterations. If multiple switching times are allowed, then an optimal policy is found by noting that the entire switching policy for one switch, up to the decision horizon, is characterized by the adjoint variable. Applying this logic backwards, successively including additional switches up to the decision horizon, leads to a natural dynamic-programming solution of the cash-flow switching problem. The results are further generalized to multiple cash-flow streams, switching costs, as well as switch-triggered cash-flow streams that arise in equipment-replacement problems.

The performance of the proposed heuristic algorithms will be justified by comparing its solutions with the optimal solutions given by a standard optimization software, since it is shown that this problem can be formulated as an Integer Linear Programming problem.", :title "A discrete competitive location problem with additional constraints", :keyword2 0, :authors (3363 3354 31303 7450), :session 537}, 1035 {:keyword1 97, :keyword3 110, :abstract "In service systems, the service level is often represented by a percentile of the waiting time.

One kind of time series which is of major interest, from both academic and practical perspectives, is the short-term electric energy consumption. In this connection, this paper expands the fields of application of combined Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) and exponential smoothing methods to the electric sector in order to obtain more accurate demand forecasts. Different approaches are tested using monthly data from 9 countries (Australia, Brazil and G7 countries) and a comparative out-of-sample analysis is conducted on the basis of several performance metrics. The results show that a combination of a seasonal-trend decomposition, a moving block bootstrap (MBB) aggregation approach and specific exponential smoothing methods can substantially improve the forecast accuracy of the demand for energy end-use services in different countries. In many cases the gains are noteworthy when compared with single forecasts on the real data. For the Australian electricity consumption, for instance, the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error and the Root Mean Squared Error obtained using a MBB Multiplicative Holt-Winters approach were almost 49% and 60% lower than the ones obtained in a single Multiplicative Holt-Winters forecast on the real data.

Typical reasons for that are different timetables associated with different seasons, maintenance periods or holidays. Therefore, the regular lifetime of a timetable is split into (more or less) irregular periods where parts of the timetable are changed. In order to operate a timetable most railway companies set up sequences that define the operation of timetabled trips by a single physical railway vehicle called (rolling stock) rotations. Not surprisingly, the individual parts of a timetable also affect the rotations. More precisely, each of the parts brings up an acyclic rolling stock rotation problem with start and end conditions associated with the beginning and ending of the corresponding period. We propose propagation approach to deal with large planning horizons that are composed of many timetables with shorter individual lifetimes. The approach is based on an integer linear programming formulation that propagates rolling stock rotations through the irregular parts of the timetable while taking a large variety of operational requirements into account.

The use of street-level land usage data allows further conclusions to be made about the reasons for these behaviours. The indicators developed, in addition to facility usage information, are then used to develop and estimate a dynamic next location choice model.

For such incompatible pairs, kidney exchange programs (KEP) have been developed, where incompatible donor patient (DP) pairs exchange their donor’s kidney via cycles or chains to get a compatible kidney for the patient. Another pathway for kidney transplants is via cadaveric donation.  When a cadaveric donor becomes available, both kidneys are given to wait list patients according to a ranked list and compatibility. Our idea is to merge both these transplant processes and create cadaver driven chains from a registry containing both incompatible DP pairs and cadaveric wait list patients. Since a cadaveric donor has two kidneys, one of them can be used to create a chain where the kidney is given to paired patient and the intended donor will donate it to some other pair and last donor of the chain will donate a kidney to a patient in cadaveric wait list. Thus there is no loss to the wait list patients and few paired patients will get a compatible kidney. An Integer programming model for cadaver driven chains is created and simulations are done on representative data sets. The results shows that significant gains can be achieved via this merged process in terms of number of transplants and reduced waiting times for a compatible kidney.", :title "Cadaver driven chains in kidney exchange program", :keyword2 0, :authors (53261 54923 28300 54925), :session 584}, 1111 {:keyword1 103, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The strongly NP-hard Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW) is concerned with visiting a\r\nset of customers within their assigned time windows such that a given objective function is minimized.

The advantages of this approach are twofold. First, it allows the implementation of a bi-level solution algorithm, which accelerates the solution of the problem, particularly when bus capacity is constraining. Second, it allows accounting for stochastic user behavior. This kind of behavior, which had not been used in the design problem before, is more realistic, and provides more robust and reliable solutions. Our methodology was tested on nine scenarios, based on real-world corridors such as Caracas Av. in Bogotá. Our experiments show that this new methodology yields solutions for the deterministic case significantly faster than an existing benchmark algorithm.

Wineries that export to many markets must be able to meet the different labeling requirements of each of them. To avoid having to carry inventory for too many SKUs, some wineries postpone bottling until they receive an order from one of the markets they receive, while others only postpone labeling, which is usually faster than bottling. Although postponing only labeling allows more flexibility, since the same unlabeled bottle may be used for any market, it requires additional handling of the bottles. Therefore, unless the benefit of labeling postponement is significant, it is better to bottle and label directly. To assess the benefits of labeling postponement, a multi-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming model with full recourse for demand scenarios for planning wine production was developed. This model was used to simulate the operation of the winery under different conditions of capacity and demand uncertainty. The results of the numerical experiments showed that postponed labeling outperforms bottling and labeling when capacity is tight.  Conversely, when production line capacity is only loosely constrained, labeling postponement loses most advantages over bottling and labeling, save for when forecasts are highly inaccurate.  Results are mixed when capacity is moderately constrained, but postponement’s advantages increase when there are less accurate forecasts.", :title "Assessing the effects of variability and capacity tightness on the performance of labeling postponement for an export-winery under demand uncertainty", :keyword2 7, :authors (1917 33040 13082 15744), :session 902}, 1124 {:keyword1 67, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In a recent paper, the Spectral Simplex Gradient Method (SpecSimplex) was introduced to solve non-smooth derivative-free unconstrained optimization problems.

Currently, transshipment in some blood supply chains is based on the age profile of units in hospitals.

In this paper, we propose a new transshipment policy for perishable items based on the age of the oldest item in the system to improve supply-chain performance. The proposed model has applications for transshipping blood units between hospitals. We develop a heuristic solution using partial differential equations to compute performance measures and cost function. The results demonstrate that our transshipment policy is effective under various circumstances such as lost sale and backordering. We also compare the performance of the suggested transshipment policy to the transshipment policy that is currently practiced in Australian hospitals.

This is due to its complex manufacturing processes and long overall processing times. Therefore it is necessary to optimize the manufacturing process.

Optimizing a supply chain in semiconductor industry is very challenging, because of the dispersion of the facilities all over the world and the complexity of each facility.\r\nIn this paper a mathematical method for optimizing a supply chain in semiconductor industry is presented. The goal is to compute near-optimal release dates for each lot by given due dates for each part of the supply chain. As objectives the tardiness, the cycle time and the earliness are used. The underlying scheduling problem is solved by constraint programming. During the solution process two different objective functions are used: a weighted sum and a multi criteria optimization.\r\nThe developed method is tested with a supply chain model that contains one frontend facility, one die bank and one backend facility. The results of the optimization are compared against a simulation model using dispatching rules. Finally the results of the optimization have been simulated, to test how good they can do in practice. In summary it can be stated that the CP optimization outperforms the simulation with dispatching rules for all three objectives.\r\n", :title "A mathematical approach for the optimization of a supply chain in semiconductor industry", :keyword2 83, :authors (54107 54108 20291), :session 164}, 1174 {:keyword1 106, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The public and commercial demand of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is growing exponentially in near future.

Oversampling techniques show a good overall performance and do not seem to suffer from overfitting as traditional studies report. A variety of undersampling techniques are investigated and show the performance degrading effect of instances showing odd behaviour. Furthermore, the boosting process indicates that the regularization parameter in the SVM formulation acts as a weakness indicator and that a combination of weak learners can often achieve better generalization than a single strong learner.

For this second-best market coupling approach, nodal injections are estimated by so-called generation shift keys (GSKs). This approximation makes FLB-MC a robust optimization problem, if uncertainties in GSKs are considered properly. This affects capacity margins and thus reduces the solution space. Therefore the flow reliability margin (FRM), a security margin on lines, arising from GSK uncertainty is derived analytically and assessed numerically.

Feasible dynamic pricing strategies include second-degree price discrimination offering intertemporal consumption bundles in the form of rental and/or purchase options. We find that as the population’s sharing propensity increases, possibly due to a cultural shift from ownership to access-based consumption, the durable-goods monopolist’s optimal strategy shifts from unbundling (offering exclusively rentals), via mixed bundling (offering the options of rental and purchase side-by-side), to pure bundling (purchase only). We find that an increase in sharing propensity has an ambiguous effect on the firm’s profit. Cultural shifts from low to high sharing propensity may be delayed by a firm’s attempts to artificially disable sharing markets by offering overly low rental rates. However, beyond a certain threshold of sharing propensity, the firm actually prefers a faster cultural transition to an access-based economy.

Capacity-constrained distribution systems have larger drop sizes, and the number of deliveries is limited by vehicle capacity. Results show that, for time-constrained distribution systems, OHD in any proportion are always advantageous from a cost standpoint, as corroborated by literature.

The surface then serves as input for an expected profit measure, estimated as the volume under the surface.

This strategic situation can be described as a bilevel optimization model. At the upper level, an investor decides on investments while anticipating the market results. At the lower level, a market operator maximizes revenue given consumer demand and installed generation assets as well as producer price bids.

Traditionally, we begin analyzing project risk by determining the inherent uncertainty in a project’s cash flows. The best that we can expect to do is to estimate range of possible future costs and benefits and relative chances of achieving a reasonable return on the investment. Once we obtain the net present value (NPV) distribution by aggregating these periodic cash flows over the investment life, we may be able to determine the NPV at risk through the conditional value at risk (CVaR) concept. It basically calculates the expected loss on an investment, if a certain level of loss is bound to occur over a given time period at a specified degree of confidence.  If a typical investor is willing to accept an investment, we may view this amount (CVaR) as his risk tolerance associated with the project. It is important to recognize that real investments are not single decisions without future flexibility, but rather multiple interacting options driven by various uncertainties. Therefore, investors may be interested in hedging this expected loss (CVaR) by using various real options. In this paper, we will explore a procedure to price the value of this changing option for investors whose risk tolerance determined by the CVaR.

We propose a new approximation approach for MSLPs, two-stage LDRs. The idea is to require only a subset of decision variables in the primal/dual of the MSLP to follow an LDR, which is sufficient to obtain an upper/lower approximation of an MSLP that is a two-stage stochastic linear program (2SLP). Although solving the corresponding 2SLP approximations is intractable in general, we investigate how approximate solution approaches that have been developed for solving 2SLP can be applied to solve these approximation problems. In addition to potentially yielding better policies and bounds, our approach requires many fewer assumptions than are required to obtain an explicit reformulation when using the standard static LDR approach. When we apply our approach to a capacity expansion model, we find that the two-stage LDR policy has expected cost between 20% and 34% lower than the static LDR policy, and in the dual yields lower bounds that are between 0.1% and 3.3% better.", :title "Two-stage linear decision rules for multi-stage stochastic programming", :keyword2 93, :authors (54173 34217), :session 590}, 1323 {:keyword1 158, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In radiation therapy, a common cancer treatment, treatments must be carefully designed to deliver appropriate dose to targets while avoiding healthy organs.

Network consolidation is a mechanism for these businesses to minimize costs. Our research studied network consolidation for businesses constrained by location, service demand, and service capacity. An algorithm was implemented for optimal consolidation of a constrained network that would minimize cost while retaining prescribed service levels. The model is a modified assignment algorithm in which the constraints come from network specifications and service levels. The algorithm is designed to eliminate underutilized high-cost providers. Consumer demand by region is satisfied with the minimal amount of providers resulting in the overall minimal network cost.\r\nInitially, consolidation of a Federal DSL network resulted in a 70 percent reduction in annual expenses. Service provided remained the same while network growth was enabled. Reducing total network cost while holding the number of customer’s steady resulted in cost reductions for the customer and profit increases for the provider. The preliminary study was previously presented at the 2016 Annual INFORMS Meeting. \r\nA rigorous sensitivity analysis and simulation provides a predictive representation of the algorithm’s ability to react to network growth. The model is able to predict network growth and future consolidation.

In semiconductor manufacturing, the vacuum pump is mainly used to make the status in the chamber to vacuum. Failure of the vacuum pump can cause wasted time and cost by damaging the wafers being produced in the facility and performing unplanned maintenance. Therefore, it is important to monitor the condition of the pump and predict the failure in advance so that the pump is replaced or maintained before the failure occurs. The frequency data collected from the vibration sensor attached to the pump is used to detect a sudden failure of the pump. The amount of data is very large because the vibration sensor continuously collects the data during the process. Therefore, we extract the significant features of the frequency domain and time domain from the vibration signal data to reduce the size of data and remove noise. Based on the extracted features, we propose a health index to monitor pump life and predict failure. In this paper, the proposed method is tested and verified by using vibration sensor data collected from actual semiconductor process. The health index is expected to help engineers make better decisions about pump maintenance and replacement before breakdown.

The demand in the flow-capturing location-allocation problem is the traffic flow on the road network. More than two facilities located on a single route between an origin and a destination consume the same traffic demand for the route. This is called “cannibalization” and must be considered when selecting charging facility locations. We develop the model to fit EV charging facility needs based on the flow-capturing location-allocation problem. This location problem has issues unique to EV charging facilities. The EV running distance is much shorter than that of gasoline-powered vehicles. It also takes a much longer time to charge a battery than to simply refuel a vehicle. In formulating this problem, we have tried to integrate these features of EV charging facilities into the model. We solved the location problem numerically using relaxed linear programing.

Out Storage is the temporary storage to keep the lots which wait for OHS (Overhead Hoist System) to send to the stocker in other bay.

Besides, the equipment behaviors and confidence level will be taken into account to increase the estimation accuracy of capacity requirement.

Since waiting times are not allowed a new method is proposed to check if a route is time window feasible. To allow time window violations during the local search, four different penalty methods are proposed and compared in terms of solution quality and computational time. The routing problem is solved using an iterated granular tabu search which finds new best-known solutions for all benchmark instances from the literature.

One of the main purposes of the batch plant design problem is to select the optimal number and size of equipment units for every production stage, out of a discrete set of available sizes, so as to minimise capital and operating costs, while taking into account design and horizon constraints. This challenging combinatorial problem has been studied extensively in literature and is generally formulated as an MINLP model that is solved exactly. However, in contrast to previous research where a single production line design problem is solved, we extend the batch plant design problem with parallel lines, each having the same number of production stages. This extended design problem involves now determining the optimal number of production lines to install and distributing the production (quantities) over these lines. As these additional decisions increase complexity significantly, the problem becomes intractable for exact solution methods. In this talk, we present a matheuristic that combines exact solution techniques with heuristics in order to solve the multi-line design problem in a reasonable amount of time.

Within the field there is already a considerable amount of empirical evidence regarding human inability to understand stock/flow relationships and difficulties in extrapolating exponential trajectories, along with a long-standing interest in deficiencies in mental models and their consequences for system performance.

The trade-off is based on the assumption, that suppliers are not able to maintain the same level of quality if quantity increases. Considering heterogeneous quality settings it is analyzed, how the market shares of the suppliers change over an observation period when systematically changing the quantity-quality trade-off level exogenously. To answer this research question an agent-based simulation is conducted, which is an appropriate approach to study systems of heterogeneous and interacting agents (e.g., interactions between suppliers). The first research findings suggest that with a relatively, though not extremely high quantity-quality trade-off stronger fluctuations regarding the supplier market shares occur during the first time steps of the observation period - no matter the initial supplier quality.

Then, in the second stage, future customers are known and routes satisfying the first stage time windows are planned. The objective is to minimize the expected cost of the second stage.

Due to trade-offs the manufacturer’s dilemma is whether to offer a high quality, high price product which will appeal to a small group of high quality seeking customers who are willing to pay handsomely, or offer a lower quality product at a lower price in order to attract more customers and boost demand. We study two strategies that the manufacturer can employ to mitigate this dilemma and increase profit: (i) segment the market by offering coupons to targeted customers and sell the product at multiple prices, and (ii) segment the market by offering two vertically differentiated products at two prices and allow customers to self-select the product that provides them with the highest utility. Furthermore, we combine the two strategies to achieve additional segmentation and find that, most often, offering targeted coupons, the manufacturer should not modify the products’ qualities.

The approach has a simple geometric interpretation, and allows for quick uncertainty-region updates and effective optimization-based heuristics for adaptive question selection. However, its performance deteriorates with high error rates. We show how, by using ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, one can include respondent error and develop a purely geometric approach that is as intuitive as the polyhedral approach, but nearly matches what a Bayesian approach would do. The approach extends the effectiveness of the polyhedral approach to the high response error setting and provides a geometric interpretation of Bayesian approaches.

In this paper we present a general approach to plan the level of inventory of multiple slow-moving items in a single location. Inventories of slow-moving items are particularly difficult to manage due to their sporadic demand. In addition, the uncertainty distribution of such demand does not necessarily match a well known distribution profile. Therefore, traditional inventory methods that assume a certain form of demand distribution to determine inventory policies do not perform well. Moreover, to mitigate the risk in practice, it is also common to impose targets for demand satisfaction (service level) or budgets on a group of items rather than an individual item. We present an approach to determine a set of inventory policies for a large number of items in the same group. To satisfy the global targets, we develop a column generation algorithm where a master problem is used to select a set of policies for all the items in the group with the objective to minimize overall costs while satisfying these targets. A set of subproblems, one for each item, is used to generate new inventory policies that are then added to the master problem.

I focus on Finnish heating consumption given that domestic electricity heating consumption is two thirds of household consumption. I use a thermodynamic model to track household temperatures and then allow an agent to buy electricity in the day-ahead spot market and then buy or sell in the stochastic within-day market. The agent chooses quantities to buy in the spot market, bid curves to submit to the balancing market, and how to distribute the remaining energy across the fleet of houses. I find that the gains from operating in both markets are relatively small, and sometimes negative for three reasons. Firstly, the stochastic nature of the balancing market results in the agent potentially ending up on the wrong side of the market. Secondly, the agent must commit to spot market purchases up to 36 hours before dispatch. Thirdly, the agent must compensate households for temperature variations.

Through data mining and simulation modelling of the ward and “smart” system, we assess the level of improvement that these new technologies provide, as well as explore alternative strategies for how they can be further leveraged to improve response times, efficiency and care quality in the unit.", :title "Mackenzie health: An analysis of a “smart” Internet of Things approach to healthcare", :keyword2 145, :authors (54384), :session 581}, 1658 {:keyword1 101, :keyword3 148, :abstract "Wildland fire is ecologically essential for forest health in Canada, but can also be a threat to public safety, forest communities, timber values and infrastructure. Wildland-urban interface fires can result in evacuations, health impacts due to smoke, property loss, and loss of employment and business income. Fire risk assessment is crucial in fuel treatment planning and fire suppression operations, especially when communities and values are at risk. Although wildland fire is influenced by a number of factors (flammable biomass, weather, topography, and ignition sources), the impact of weather is critically important.  High intensity, uncontrollable wildfires most commonly occur during extremes in weather. With climate change, extreme periods of weather will occur more often, which may bring more extreme fire occurrence. Developing the spatially explicit and nationally consistent estimates of the current and future fire risk will help fire management agencies identify and prioritize critical at-risk areas, providing guidance for wildfire mitigation programs. Here, we present a framework for developing a series of Canada-wide, baseline fire characteristics (including burn probability, fire intensity and fuel consumption), and fire risk maps for current and future climate change scenarios across Canada.

Optimizing the transportation system itself will lead to a better balance between the quality of the transfers and their cost.\r\nIn order to standardize, we design a support decision tool to help choose the right type of transportation and accompanying for patients. This tool is based on a decision tree built after several interviews with healthcare professionals. Once provided the request for transport, a dispatcher should decide which vehicle will be used and when. Different strategies for booking are tested using a simulation model. We also take advantage of the model to test routing scenarios, introduce new vehicles (such as internal fleet), and finally test levels of centralization. In particular, we investigate if serving the transport requests of all the health care facilities of Montreal with a unique network would provide high savings.

Controlled charging, however, can avoid such problem and can also provide additional services to the grid, such as peak shaving and ancillary services. Therefore, it is important to have EV charging behaviors controlled and scheduled although EV availability for charging is limited and stochastic. We focus on the real time scheduling problem for EV charging with a stochastic linear programming model. The model optimizes charging behavior for multiple EVs and the objective is to try maintaining total charging demand at a predefined level. The considered uncertainty in the model is the number of EVs that will be available for charging in the future. When optimizing charging scheduling for currently available EVs, the model also considers the possibility that more EVs may be available for scheduling in future periods. Based on empirical EV usage data, EV data used in the model are simulated with inhomogeneous Markov models. Rolling window approach is applied for real time scheduling. The importance to properly select a predefined charging level is discussed. An example to participate in reserve market is given and the limit of EV charging flexibility is explained.

In radiation therapy, waits may translate into loss of local control of cancer and deterioration of quality of life. Wait times are often a direct consequence of an imbalance between capacity and demand, but also a result of inefficient patient scheduling. Highly variable demand, complex treatment fractionations and varying machine requirements, together with limited treatment capacity, make it extremely difficult for a booking agent to manually assess the impact of his/her decisions in order to more efficiently allocate capacity. This unintended lack of foresight may translate into unnecessary delays, a non-systematic prioritization of patients, unused appointment slots and excessive overtime. We formulate and approximately solve a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process for scheduling cancer treatments in radiation therapy units. The main purpose of this model is to identify good policies for allocating available treatment capacity to incoming demand, while reducing wait times in a cost-effective manner.

As a result, we find that the nuclear power for the Japanese people has six factors of \"positive image\", \"negative image\", \"benefit recognition\", \"risk recognition\", \"difficulty in understand\", and \"complexity\". It turns out that some people with \"negative image\" have a certain number that had negative feelings against nuclear power without thinking of benefits and risks. In terms of aging, we show that in 2011 the proportion of \"negative image\" and \"risk recognition\" have increased rapidly.

This classification system is based on the Pareto principle and commonly uses a single criterion, typically annual dollar usage, to determine groupings of the items. Category A items or high dollar usage items are few in number and account for 10-20% of inventory items and thus require tight inventory controls. Category B items are medium dollar items requiring regular control mechanisms. Approximately 30% of items fall into this category. Category C items are low dollar use items which are large in quantity, approximately 60-80%, and require minimal inventory control. While this approach is simple, it works in cases where all items are homogeneous and differ in terms of this criterion. In many cases, the items held in inventory are not homogeneous and may differ in terms of other criteria such as lead time and criticality.

The operating strategies involve finding the total number of trips across all buses and their respective sequence to achieve the given objective. Mixed integer time-indexed linear programming models have been formulated to develop these strategies.  One of the models helps emergency managers in strategic planning by finding the minimum number of buses that must be available at respective depots to achieve the target evacuation time. Another model is developed to identify the detailed sequence of trips and their respective routes to be followed for a given evacuation scenario. To test the efficacy of the developed models, a case study is presented in which evacuation is required due to occurrence of a nuclear accident.

Then the measurement models of the risk factors are determined by conducting confirmatory factor analysis. The factors’ corresponding measurement indicators are designed and confirmed by sample data. Thirdly, a BN model for risk analysis is developed. The initial BN structure is developed based on the measurement indicators and then is optimized by the partial least squares algorithm. Lastly, the BN model is evaluated by conducting a comparative analysis with other advanced methods. Sample data was collected from 169 Chinese companies. Experimental results show that the proposed risk analysis method has high prediction accuracy.", :title "Risk analysis for project portfolios using a Bayesian network model", :keyword2 24, :authors (53905 54514 58015), :session 588}, 1817 {:keyword1 7, :keyword3 93, :abstract "This paper considers a sustainable agricultural supply chain management to find the optimal matching between farmers and retailers with the contract based on their higher satisfactions of the total return. It is important to construct the food distribution system to hold the win-win relationship among all stakeholders in terms of sustainability. Furthermore, it is also important to find the optimal matching and trading volume between farmers and retailers to maximize the total profit, because the total volume of a product at a specific farmer should be sold out at a specific retailer to need it. Of course, there is uncertainty of production volume due to weather and soil conditions. If the production volume at each farmer in one time slot is all shipped to the retailer, the retailer has some risks such as shortage costs and discarding costs. Therefore, in this paper, the mathematical model of agricultural supply chain management with weather derivative to avoid the above-mentioned risks is formulated.

A typical SIS process undergoes three phases: data acquisition, data analytics, and service provision. We will discuss several major research issues associated with the main phases of the SIS process, including which data to collect, how to collect and manage them, how to analyze them, which information to extract, and how to utilize the information in designing and developing new services.

In the worst case, the algorithm continues until a full representation of the network is reached, which would not provide a speed-up.

In such policies, the entire system is shut down for a certain period and the whole system is maintained at once. Such policies allow for the maintenance activities to be clustered and planned long in advance, thereby minimizing system downtime as well as logistics costs, e.g., by reducing the need to stock many spare parts between turnarounds. However, the time between consecutive  turnarounds is often large and machines may deteriorate faster then expected. In such situations, an interesting question is whether it can be profitable to reduce production rates in order to avoid the need for maintenance before a turnaround. The current maintenance literature typically assumes that machines always produce at its maximum production rate and that we therefore cannot influence the deterioration rate. However, there are many real life situations where we can adjust the production rates. For example, wind turbines can decelerate by adjusting the angle of the blades which results in lower production rates as well as reduced deterioration rates due to less vibration and lower heat production. We research the option to adjust production rates based on condition information.

A mixed integer linear programming model formulation is proposed. To solve the model, a simulation-based solution approach is developed, including a simulation step and a gradient-based optimisation step.

In decision theory, the expected utility theory and the non-expected utility theory are distinguished according to this discrepancy. Many normative risk measures are consistent with a convex utility function. RES, on the other hand, is consistent with a value function in the prospect theory, which has been developed in behavioral economics. It is known that a decision that minimizes the expected shortfall maximizes the expected utility function. In our framework, we showed that there exist the similar relationships between RES and the value function in the prospect theory.

Exploration decisions have uncertain inputs; e.g. both the existence of economic hydrocarbon volumes and the future oil prices are uncertain.

When prospects are geologically dependent, finding oil in one location might increase the chance of success in nearby locations. A dry hole may decrease the chance of success in adjacent prospects. Bickel and Smith (2006) addressed these informational relationships and calculated an optimal drilling sequence and its associated value. In practice, it takes time to interpret the drilling data and update the understanding about neighboring prospects, a span during which oil price variations may also change the economics of the upcoming wells. As a result, the optimal sequence of drilling decisions is a function of both the evolution of oil prices and geological dependencies.

Different from existing literature, our intention is to reveal the incentive among banks for collaboration to mitigate crises in financial networks.

Using field data, we show that it can be in the interest of banks to cooperate and prevent the domino effect which would hurt everyone.

We select the outpatient data of HIS system of a hospital from 2014 to 2015, and the matching air quality data in Chengdu, China.Odds Ratio (OR) risk factors assessment method  was used to evaluate the effect of air pollution in a short time (3 to 14 days) on the average daily outpatient visits in the next 7 days. Then, we used the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) to evaluate the explanatory degree of air pollution in a short-term for the corresponding 7-day average daily outpatient visits. The results shows that Lag8_7_151 has the highest risk of high daily outpatient visits, with OR of 4.263 (0.255 to 71.271, CI = 95%), but a significance test> 0.05. The MIC of the independent variable Out-Visits (daily outpatient visits) and the dependent variable Mean_Lag14  is 0.255, while the maximum MIC of the independent variable Out-rank (a 0-1 variable, namely the grade of outpatient visits) and the dependent variable Lag13_4_151 is less than 0.01.

Several classes of risk measures, such as mean (semi-)deviation and mean (semi-)moment measures, fail to be mixture-quasiconcave and can therefore give rise to problems in which the decision maker might benefit from a randomizated policy. Under distributional ambiguity, on the other hand, we show that for any ambiguity averse risk measure there always exists a decision problem (with a non-convex, e.g., mixed-integer, feasible region) in which a randomized decision strictly dominates all deterministic decisions.", :title "\"Dice\"-sion making under uncertainty: When can a random decision reduce risk?

As a result, a solution assumes that all items are cut in the same production period or the production period does not matter. In this paper we consider a multi-period problem where the demand is not available, or permitted to be cut, until a designated production period. While this could be solved as multiple bin packing problems, when off-cuts of material can be used in the following periods, there is a dependency between cutting plans. Moreover, when the storage and setup cost are considered, then the benefit to keeping usable leftovers is more complex than simply minimising the use of material. Finally, when the material can be procured in a range of standard size stock sheets, the selection of the standard sizes also affects the optimisation. The presentation will explore these questions for the irregular shape bin packing problem. Metal cutting industries would be a typical example of this.

This approach is reported to simultaneously provide the switching speed and simplicity of rings with the much greater efficiency for reconfiguration of a mesh network. A single unit capacity p-cycle is a cycle having one spare channel on each span it crosses. It provides one protection path for a failed span on the cycle and it also protects spans that have both end nodes on the cycle but are not on the cycle.

Since these operations are interrelated, their interdependence cannot be ignored to avoid suboptimal solutions and inefficient schedules and routes. Thus, instead of solving order picking problems and vehicle routing problems separately using an uncoordinated approach, these two supply chain functions should be integrated into a single optimization problem. The integrated order picking-vehicle routing problem (OP-VRP) considers simultaneously the requirements and constraints of both subproblems. The integrated problem determines picking lists and vehicle routes at a time. E-commerce companies often offer their customers the possibility to select a time frame in which they want to be delivered. Accordingly, time windows are taken into account the integrated OP-VRP. Integration can lead to cost savings and higher service levels. Since the two subproblems are hard to solve to optimality, the integrated problem can only be solved to optimality with an exact solution method for small-size instances.

Therefore, it is important to allocate limited resources between testing and treating such that the benefits resulting from better-informed treatment decisions can be expected to offset the negative impact of decreasing the amount of resources for treatment. The identification of optimal testing and treatment strategies requires optimizing across the entire population of patients. It is necessary to define how to divide the population into different risk segments, how to allocate resources to each risk segment, and which tests and treatments to carry out to each segment within these resources. If there are multiple tests, treatments, and testing stages, solving this optimization problem becomes computationally challenging. We develop a model for the identification of testing and treatment strategies that maximize the expected health outcome for the population subject to limited resources. Our model helps understand how changes in the level of total resources affect (i) the optimal segmentation, (ii) the choices of tests and treatments for each segment, and (iii) the health outcome of the population.

If the supplier’s capacity is recovered after the delivery time, the supplier should pay a penalty cost to the buyer for each unit of lost sale demand and for the amount of time that the supply is delayed. Also, similar to the supplier situation, the buyer incurs a penalty cost for each unit of lost sale demand and for the amount of the waiting time. \r\nBecause the supplier can decrease the recovery completion time, the buyer may offer a financial subsidy incentive to the supplier (sole sourcing with a financial subsidy incentive strategy) or source from two suppliers (dual sourcing strategy).

Motivated by this fact, we introduce broadly applicable decision-dependent polyhedral uncertainty sets, which allow us to capture functional changes in correlations induced by given decisions, as well as to eradicate conservatism eﬀects from parameters that become irrelevant in view of the optimal decisions. The modeling capabilities afforded to us by using these new decision-dependent sets are illustrated in the context of various case studies that feature endogenous uncertainty, such as capacity expansion, offshore-oil planning, process scheduling, and clinical trial planning.

An interactive analytical tool was created that predicts the optimal allocation of funding (scan hours) within each LHIN incorporating hospital-level performance indicators. Method: Analyses were developed using the Wait Time Information System. MRI demand was predicted for the next three years for different queues using time series analysis. A mathematical model produced optimal allocation of funding to improve two wait time performance indicators: percent of scans completed within access target; and 90th percentile wait time. Policy-relevant parameters allowed users to customize growth in MRI demand; scan efficiency and throughput; P3 waitlist reduction; and equity by balancing indicator values across hospitals. Results: LHINs use the tool to examine predicted MRI demand and the corresponding effect of performance metrics. Reductions in 90th percentile wait times for lower priority scans were observed when using optimized funding allocations. The 90th percentile wait times also decreased based on improved efficiency sand throughput; and decreased by minimizing the discrepancy in indicator values across hospitals within the LHIN of interest. Conclusion: LHINs requested a tool to assist in allocating funding for MRI scans in Ontario to improve access to services.

We analyze the effects of public policies on the patients’ preferences regarding hospital choices and the results of these choices on social utility and public spending. Public and private hospitals have different qualities and service levels and patients need to pay different amounts. Public hospitals, in general, are cheaper, but more crowded and offer lower quality service than private ones. In order to decrease the high waiting times in public hospitals and to offer better service, the government makes certain contracts with the private hospitals that will effect some of the patients’ choices and increase the number of people going to the private hospitals instead of to the public ones. In these contracts, the government negotiates the prices that will be set by the private hospitals and also agrees to pay a certain amount per patient to these hospitals, which will decrease the amount that the patients need to pay when they go to private hospitals. As a result of this decrease in prices, more patients are directed to private hospitals leading to lower densities in public hospitals and a higher social utility in general.

Pursuing this purpose, we consider two approaches: (i) top-down approach and (ii) bottom-up approach. For the bottom-up approach, we first generate intervals for each feature and then produce hyper-rectangles by integrating them, where the length of intervals can be parameterized. Top-down approach makes maximum interval for each feature and divide it into sub-intervals. HRDs constructed for a given data set define a classification model. During this procedure, we can also extract patterns that a data set originally has, which can be used for characterizing the data set. In contrast to main one-class classifiers such as SVM and neural network, the suggested methods can provide the reason about the classification results using HRDs.

This concentration phenomenon is possible because of large number of available options that patients can choose from. The objective of this study is to examine the hospital choice of emergency patients by comparing the cost of choosing the actual and alternative options. We define and measure the proximity index of emergency hospitals that are accessible by patients transported by ambulance within a specific travel time threshold. We utilize the actual incident locations and road networks to calculate the routing of ambulances and corresponding travel times using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  The proximity index is calculated and compared within hospitals, age groups, conscious states, and disease subgroups. The results show that one of the biggest hospitals in the city is preferred by people although the cost of choosing is approximately a double of the overall average and that non-urgent patients tend not to choose the best option.

The option of bundling forest areas can be one where buyers need to form “full” or “partial” bundles. In “full bundling”, a company bids on combinations of stands so that the total volume covers his needs. However, this constraint is relaxed in “partial bundling”. It is difficult to tell which configuration is more efficient than the other. This depends on the rules defined by the seller to govern these systems and on the strategies adopted by the companies to meet these rules. Thus, comparisons need to be made.

The 3D Printer Head Problem is to optimise 3D printing time by minimising the head's non-extrusion distance travelled. It is a constrained CO problem closely related to the TSP. A tour is a sequence of extrusion moves, viewed as extended vertices. The start and end of an extended vertex need not be the same point: thus the direction of an extrusion move affects the head location on completing that move, and so affects the total non-extrusion travel time. Extrusion moves cannot be omitted or shortened; however, their sequence may be reordered subject to constraints, and an extrusion move's direction may be reversed. Constraints are: each extrusion move is carried out exactly once; related boundary moves are grouped; a fill move must succeed the two boundaries between which it fills; non-extrusion moves are assumed to be straight lines. For each slice of the 3D object, the objective function to be minimised is the sum of Euclidean distances between the end point of extrusion move i and the start point of extrusion move i+1.

The method, also called water flooding or secondary recovery, increases the pressure and thereby stimulate production. The water is injected from a set of injection wells, and the total liquid (oil and water) is produced from a set of production wells.  A reservoir management strategy to maximize the long-term profit attempts to find the optimal control of the water flooding campaign.  The control variables of the wells are usually either pressure, flow rate or choke valve position, determined over a time horizon. A direct method parameterizes the control trajectory and cast the original infinite dimensional optimization problem into a finite solution space. The problem is then solved using reservoir simulation and NLP optimization method, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a control parameterization method utilizing function approximations. Using synthetic two-dimensional and realistic three-dimensional reservoirs, we show that function approximation captures the infinite dimensional solution with less number of coefficients compared to the traditional piece-wise constant parameterization.

To reduce the inspection errors, each item is often inspected more than once.  The multiple inspection plan has also known as a repetitive inspection, a sequential review, or a repeat inspection. Based on the inspection results after several round of inspections, we need to estimate the defective rate and the inspector’s type I and II errors.  A particularly important task in quality management is to accurately estimate the number of defective items still remaining in the lot. In the talk, we treat the multiple inspection plan as an information system and propose the optimal plan that minimizes the total cost.

Multiple tasks can be assigned to a given module as long as their sum doesn't exceed the maximum load that the assigned module can sustain. The goal is to select the set of knapsacks, determine the number of modules required at each knapsack, and find the assignment of tasks to knapsacks (without exceeding their capacity) and modules (without exceeding their load) that maximizes the total profit. This problem combines different types of decision variables: decisions on which knapsacks to select that have global implications in terms of profit and local decisions concerning the allocation of modules for the loading of individual tasks. As the decisions at each knapsack are decorrelated, they form independent bin-packing problems. These reasons suggest exploiting the hierarchical and modular structure of the problem for faster resolution on large instances. For this purpose, we partition the formulation into a FCMKP master problem and a set of bin-packing subproblems following the logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) method.

This work explores the inherent decomposition of the IRP into the two classical problems it combines. The Benders decomposition framework we construct chooses the inventory manegement problem as master for its linking role in the IRP. As a result the methodology developed is required to deal with an ensemble of challenges that comes from having a capacitated vehicle routing as subproblem (CVRP). The first challenge is the integrality of the CVRP. The second one comes from having master problem variables in the left hand side of the subproblem formulation. Finally, in order to use state-of-the-art algorithms for the CVRP, the use of column generation algorithms in the subproblem must be addressed.

Leagile is a hybrid of two approaches, lean and agile, that entails strategically locating decoupling points based on the demand volatility of the product. The focus upstream of the decoupling point is on efficiency, while the downstream emphasis is on responsiveness. However, implementing the leagile strategy is a challenge in WPS characterised by divergent flows. High volumes of co-products and by-products are generated at multiple locations along the supply chain making it difficult to implement a specific strategy. A potential method to alleviate the problem is through permitting flexibility in silvicultural decisions which dictate the mix of assortments produced in the forest. Subsequently, implementing the leagile strategy would permit the WPS to efficiently satisfy demand. The objective of this study was to quantify WPS performance improvement attainable through implementation of the leagile approach, and permitting flexibility in silvicultural decisions. An optimization model was developed to support the preparation of monthly plans that satisfy demands from a diverse set of customers.

The number of truck loads that can be moved between two nodes in the network depends  on the driving time. A single truck may serve multiple connections during a time period (usually a working day). The total number of trips is limited by the truck's temporal availability (typically 8 hours per day), but it can be extended by renting additional trucks at (high) fixed costs. The network nodes allow for the limited storage of goods over time and impose handling capacity constraints on both inbound and outbound flows. While the number of nodes and their geographical spread is relatively small, the complexity of the problem mainly arises from the time horizon length (6-8 weeks) and the huge number of commodities.

We compare several policies for dealing with spillover parking: curbside parking fees, regulating mall parking fees, and regulating mall parking capacity. Effectiveness of policies depends not only on the severity of congestion, but also on the proportion of trips taken by other modes (for example, in our case, by local shoppers who come by walking).

In particular, we focus on the fact that there are three types of areas at the ED: fast track area (patients with low severity), intake area (patients require no stretcher) and main area (remainder of patients).

In radiation therapy, waits may translate into loss of local control of cancer and deterioration of quality of life. Wait times are often a consequence of an imbalance between capacity and demand, but also result from inefficient patient scheduling. Highly variable demand, complex treatment fractionations, varying machine requirements and patient preferences, together with limited treatment capacity, make it extremely difficult for a booking agent to manually assess the impact of his/her decisions on the efficiency of capacity allocation. This unintended lack of foresight may translate into unnecessary delays, a non-systematic prioritization of patients, unused capacity and excessive overtime. We develop an integrated decision support framework for radiation therapy appointment scheduling consisting of two parts. The first part assigns treatment dates and units to incoming patients, using policies derived from a discounted infinite-horizon Markov model.

Used for instance by Geoffrion and McBride (1978), it can be exploited in several ways. The main idea is to introduce or keep in the Lagrangean model a set of constraints containing each a single 0-1 variable. These 0-1 variables must control non-overlapping subsets of the other variables. There may be constraints over the 0-1 variables alone. Ignoring these, the LRM decomposes into one submodel per 0-1 variable, which one solves with that variable set to 1, the optimum being the contribution of that variable at 1. Keeping only the 0-1 variables and their own constraints, one uses the contributions as coefficients in the LRM objective function, and solves a single 0-1 model whose optimum is the current LR bound. We present two important applications, one linear and one nonlinear. First a tile-manufacturing scheduling problem with changeover costs could be modeled so as to have the desired structure, yielding very strong LR bounds with only LPs to solve (de Matta, Guignard, 1994). Second, for some nonconvex quadratic assignment-type problems, it is possible to use an RLT-type linear model with the desired structure.

In addition, the dispatching problem attempts to balance the distinct (and potentially competing) objectives of meeting production targets and maintaining grade targets at the processing sites. Existing literature focuses on strategic planning in open-pit mining and heuristic solutions to the dispatching problem (Temeng, 1998; White, 1991). We propose an optimization-driven approach to solving the dispatching problem in the form of a MIP model. The model is difficult to solve directly within time constraints due to its large size. Therefore, we propose heuristic algorithms to quickly produce high quality feasible solutions to the model. We conclude by presenting computational results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics.", :title "Optimizing truck dispatching decisions in open-pit mining using integer programming", :keyword2 85, :authors (55016 37631 34217), :session 592}, 2511 {:keyword1 53, :keyword3 40, :abstract "Using data mining methods, this paper presents a new means of identifying freshmen's profiles likely to face major difficulties to complete their first academic year.

We adapt three data mining methods, namely random forest, logistic regression and artificial neural network algorithms. We design algorithms to increase the accuracy of the prediction when some classes are of major interest. These algorithms are context independent and can be used in different fields.  They rely on a dynamic split of the observations into subclasses during the training process, so as to maximize an accuracy criterion. Four classes are so built: high risk of failure, risk of failure, expected success or high probability of success. Real data pertaining to undergraduates at the University of Liège (Belgium), illustrates our methodology. With our approach, we are now able to identify with a high rate of confidence (90%) a subset of 12.2% of students facing a very high risk of failure, almost the quadruple of those identified with a non-dynamic approach.

The complication is that, because of computational reasons, the size of the input set of schedules must be very small (at most 2000 schedules), and therefore the quality of such a set directly influences the quality of the output PR-policy (note that there exists billions −if not an infinite number− of possible schedules).

An SDP is a natural framework to model random events causing (additional) delay, propagation of delays, and real-time speed adjustments.

It is common to see studies that consider DP as an occasional solution. However, the growth of e-commerce and the challenges this growth entails have led logistics providers to build denser networks of DP and integrate the location of these points into their planning process. Therefore, considering DP as an extra tier of the supply chain may be a more realistic approach. Moreover, the decision of location and catchment area of a DP has implications on the net VKT and it is not exclusively interesting for logistics providers but also to other stakeholders such as receivers and society represented by a public sector.

However, the proposed rates of increase result in expensive solution evaluations, making the simulated annealing algorithm inefficient compared with other metaheuristics and exact methods.

There is no standard set of terms for CoCos and the properties of CoCos vary depending on the conditions that trigger conversion and the number of common shares that CoCo holders receive upon conversion. Our modelling framework allows for general capital structures and asset value dynamics to change upon conversion. The last feature is important as upon conversion the firm no longer pays interest on the CoCos, hence pushing the drift of the asset value process towards a more favourable financial condition. This framework still allows for the analysis of CoCo design and the model is easily calibrated to data. We discuss incentives for CoCo investors to short the issuing firm’s stock in order reap profits by artificially forcing conversion. Additionally, it is common for regulators to have some discretion on when CoCos convert which induces some ambiguity on the trigger conditions.

The passing of ships of any size is possible in so-called sidings, which are widened segments of the canal. The purpose of the traffic management is to decide on the ships that have to wait in a siding in order to avoid conflicts in the transit segments.

There has been prior research on this traffic management problem in a deterministic setting. In our presentation, we extend the setting by stochastic travel times of ships and stochastic exit times when ships leave the locks and enter the canal. Various priority rules are used to produce conflict-free ship schedules of low average transit times for the deterministic setting.

We address this proposition by studying a model of a partially integrated supply chain in which the buyer holds an equity stake in the supplier.

When complex scheduling problems grow in size so as to meet reality, researchers tend to resort to metaheuristics i.e. generalist computer methods that solve these problems approximately in a relatively small amount of computation time. Metaheuristic design relies on researcher expertise but many times this design is more creative than scientific. This process has produced great results in the past, but has some drawbacks like tightly problem specific metaheuristics or challenges in reproducibility of results, among many others. \r\nRecently, there has been a lot of research effort in a completely different and novel approach: Automatic Algorithm Design (AAD). AAD is basically a meta-metaheuristic that gathers together key components that mingled in specific order and structure compose a metaheuristic aimed to perform well in a given problem. It is like algorithms constructing algorithms. We apply ADD to the Hybrid Flow Shop problem, a realistic scheduling problem that needs compromises between abstraction and specialization. We have carried out a comprehensive computational campaign considering three different optimization objectives, as a change in the objective results in a change on the solution space topology. \r\nEven though we only have preliminary results, we have proven that ADD can generate competitive algorithms that even surpass the state-of-the-art after thorough comparisons.

The designed scenarios used as experimental variables: the amount of time the respondent has been deprived of water; the expected time for a return to normalcy; and the amount of money available to the respondent at the time of the deprivation. The data were used to estimate econometric models that express the willingness-to-pay as a function of relevant variables. These models provide an understanding into the significance of anticipation effects, and their influencing factors. From the results obtained, we discuss important implications for disaster management and suggest a number of actions to mitigate these effects.", :title "Exploratory study of the anticipation effects in post-disaster environments", :keyword2 31, :authors (55248 28217 776 55247 42528 53681 55255), :session 322}, 2789 {:keyword1 118, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This paper investigates the equilibrium properties of the morning commute problem at the network level with heterogeneous trip lengths.

With alpha-beta-gamma preferences and under certain conditions, a partial FIFO pattern emerges at equilibrium among early and late users. This FIFO pattern is strict only within families of users having heterogeneous trip lengths and identical preferences, or vice versa.

Since the health labor market faces many legal and regulatory rigidities, timely and adequate planning of HHR is necessary to ensure there will be enough practitioners to attend to the needs of the population. Nurses, in particular, are a cornerstone of health care services, with a shortage potentially leading to unmet care needs. To this purpose, system-level approaches, such as System Dynamics, have been used with reasonable success to generate forecasts and assess future needs. However, micro-level approaches allow for studying behavior at the level of an individual nurse, opening a whole new realm of research questions that may now be addressed. In this work we present a stochastic agent-based simulation model to forecast the Portuguese nursing workforce until 2050.

The Positive Influence Dominating Set (PIDS) problem is defined as follows. Given a graph G = (V,E), each node i in V has a weight, denoted by b(i), and a neighbor requirement, denoted by g(i). We seek a subset P of V such that a node i not in P is adjacent to at least g(i) members of P and the sum of weights of those nodes in P is minimized. Notice, when g(i)=k for all nodes in the graph we obtain the k-dominating set problem, where k=1 gives the dominating set problem. The PIDS problem is motivated by applications on social networks. Roughly, the notion is that the set of nodes selected in P are able to influence a desirable behavior in the rest of the network. Another variant of the PIDS problem---referred to as the Total PIDS problem---requires that every node in the graph (i.e., including the nodes in P) be adjacent to g(i) nodes in P. We present a dynamic programming approach to solve both the PIDS and the TPIDS problem on trees. We then focus on the polytope of these two problems. In particular, we describe the polytope of both problems when restricted to trees. Interestingly the formulation for trees is also valid on general graphs, and thus provides a strong formulation for these problems on arbitrary graphs.

In interviews with representatives from companies, education ministries, schools, social workers, consultants, volunteer helpers, and asylum seekers, Prof. Dr. Ulrike Reisach and her team have identified some of the major challenges of both sides as well as approaches which seem to be more successful than others. In her contribution for the conference she will offer well-structured insights into the manifold dimensions and of the task for the civil society as well as for businesses and administrations. Based on interviews and a structured assessment of the communication and teaching efforts of the institutions involved, Prof. Reisach and her research team discovered a few decisive factors which support or slow down the process of inclusion. Among the positive factors are intercultural competencies and a deep understanding of the process of forwarding knowledge in the respective culture. This comprises understanding media usage as well as the region of origin’s traditions of schooling, teaching and learning as well as those regarding job search, application and HR development at the workplace. In the research, it turned out that companies and placement agencies which already had a diverse workforce and deep intercultural experience were more successful in developing appropriate programs than others. Nevertheless, some smaller local employers were also successful with personalized inclusion efforts. The contribution will explain how framework conditions and processes in the civil society, including coalitions of employers, chambers of industry and commerce, local schools, work placement agencies, social workers, NGOs and volunteers, positively supported integrative efforts and which assumptions and attempts turned out to be less conductive.

Based on the studied literature we suggest four well-being measures to be used in rostering including work-life balance measures, fatigue and risk indicators, and deviations from Health and Safety Executive (HSE) guidelines.

The well-being measures are employed together with traditional objective functions to create rosters. We investigate to what extent the proposed well-being measures can be attained without compromising the performance of roster. The experiments demonstrate that it is possible to maintain good performance measures of rosters and at the same time improve well-being of employees by assigning appropriate weights to well-being components in the objective function.

Nonconvex problems can be reformulated as integer programs, which belong to this intractable class. Disjunctive programming formulates the integrality conditions as disjunctions, and represents the first major inroad into dealing with nonconvexity: disjunctive sets, brought to the form of unions of polyhedra, are nonconvex sets whose convex hull has a compact representation in a space of dimension linear in the number of polyhedra in the union.The disjunctive or lift-and-project approach to cutting plane theory has provided tools that have contributed decisively to the revolution in the state of the art of integer programming that took place starting with the 1990's. In the case of lift-and-project (L&P) cuts from split disjunctions, a correspondence established between bases of the higher dimensional cut generating linear program and those of the original LP relaxation have made it possible to generate L&P cuts directly from the original LP tableau, without recourse to the higher-dimensional representation. This has led to efficient implementations of L&P cuts in public (COIN_OR) and commercial (XPRESS, CPLEX, MOPTA) MIP solvers. Recent research, focused on establishing similar results for L&P cuts from more general disjunctions, has led to rather different conclusions. Namely, while easily verifiable conditions were established for a L&P cut from a general disjunction D to be regular, i.e. equivalent to a standard intersection cut from a polyhedral counterpart of D, in the absence of those conditions the L&P cut, in this case termed irregular, has remarkable properties (like cutting part of the corner polyhedron). Furthermore, far from being exceptional, irregular cuts turn out to be more frequent than regular ones. While irregular L&P cuts cannot be generated by pivoting in the LP tableau, they can be generated as final point cuts from general disjunctions – a recently studied class that promises to bring about an organic synthesis of branch and bound (B&Bd) with cutting plane theory. These cuts are derived from the reverse polar of the disjunctive set defined by the active branches of a B&Bd tree, which can be represented by a set of inequalities in the space of the original MIP. This procedure – more efficient than its L&P counterpart - can be used to capture information from a partial B&Bd tree in the form of cuts valid for the entire tree.", :title "Disjunctive programming as a tool for convexifying nonconvex sets", :keyword2 0, :authors (4194), :session 815}, 2865 {:keyword1 62, :keyword3 0, :abstract "A bilevel optimization problem consists in an optimization problem in which some of the constraints specify that a subset of variables must be an optimal solution to another optimization problem.

I view these systems through OR/OM/IE lenses, often more specifically as a queueing scientist (e.g. “enjoying” congestion and flows), and sometimes using operational characteristics as surrogates for financial, psychological and clinical performance. The theory of queueing is ideally suitable for capturing the operational tradeoff that is at the core of any service: quality vs. efficiency. Three cases in point are the Erlang‐A, ‐R and ‐S models: the first has become a common call center model, by accommodating the choice that customers enjoy, namely wait for service or abandon; the second arose from emergency departments, in which returns to service are prevalent; and the third captures operational symmetry between servers and customers. All three models, or their (asymptotic) fluid or diffusion counterparts, parsimoniously yet valuably portray complex realities. Here value is tested against real service systems, which is in contrast to prevalent OR/OM/IE practice. (In that practice, models are often remote from data, and the value of fluid/diffusion models is judged by its accuracy relative to alternative models.) The ultimate goal of my research is an automatic creation, in real‐time, of data‐based models for service operations—analytical and simulation.

We present a constructive preference learning methodology, called Robust Ordinal Regression, for Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding. It is known that the dominance relation established in the set of alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria is the only objective information that comes from the formulation of a multiple criteria decision problem (ordinal classification, or ranking, or choice – with multiobjective optimization being a particular case). While it permits to eliminate many irrelevant (i.e., dominated) alternatives, it does not compare completely all of them, resulting in a situation where many alternatives remain incomparable. This situation may be addressed by taking into account preferences of the DM. Therefore, decision aiding methods require some preference information elicited from a DM or a group of DMs. This information is used to build more or less explicit preference model, which is then applied on a non-dominated set of alternatives to arrive at a recommendation presented to the DM. In practical decision aiding, the process composed of preference elicitation, preference modeling, and DM’s analysis of a recommendation, loops until the DM accepts the recommendation or decides to change the problem setting. Such an interactive process is called constructive preference learning. We will focus on processing DM’s preference information concerning multiple criteria ranking and choice problems. This information has the form of pairwise comparisons of selected alternatives, and/or comparisons of intensities of preference between pairs of some alternatives. Research indicates that such preference elicitation requires less cognitive effort from the DM than direct assessment of preference model parameters (like criteria weights, comparison thresholds, or trade-offs between conflicting criteria). We will describe how to construct from this input information a preference model being a utility function or an outranking relation, via Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR). An important feature of ROR is identification and use of all instances of the preference model that are compatible with the input preference information – this permits to draw robust conclusions in terms of necessary and possible relations in the set of considered alternatives.

In many jurisdictions, this modelling assumption is a poor fit for actual fibre consumption, which is typically a subset of total fibre allocation. Failure of the model to anticipate this bias in industrial wood fibre consumption has been linked to increased risk of wood supply failure. In particular, we examine the distributed wood supply planning problem where the roles of forest owner and fibre consumer are played by independent agents. We use game theory to frame interactions between public forest land managers and industrial fibre consumers. We show that the distributed wood supply planning problem can be modelled more accurately using a bilevel formulation, and present an extension of the classic wood supply optimisation model which explicitly anticipates industrial fibre consumption behaviour. We present a solution methodology that can solve a convex special case of the problem to global optimality, and compare output and solution times of classic and bilevel model formulations using a computational experiment on a realistic dataset.

We developed an optimization model for AED deployment, accounting for spatial and temporal accessibility, to evaluate OHCA coverage compared to a deployment based on spatial accessibility alone. Methods: We identified all non-traumatic public-location OHCAs in Toronto, Canada (2006–2014) from the Regional RescuNET OHCA Epistry and obtained a list of registered AEDs (2015) from Toronto Paramedic Services. We quantified coverage loss of registered AEDs due to limited temporal access. We then developed a spatiotemporal optimization model that determines AED locations to maximize the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100m of a location when the location was open. We computed the coverage gain between the spatiotemporal model and a spatial-only model on using 10-fold cross-validation. Statistical analyses were conducted using χ2 and McNemar’s tests. We identified 2440 atraumatic public OHCAs and 737 registered AED locations. The registered AEDs had a coverage loss of 21.5% (P<0.001); 354 of 451 OHCAs were covered when accounting for temporal information.

The next method uses a Markov chain embedded at the time service has started. Finally, we show how the distribution of the number in the system can be found from the waiting time distribution.

More recently, the applications of anomaly detection methods have seen a proliferation in business intelligence where industries such as healthcare estimate fraudulent cases, abuse, and waste. In addition, social media has dawned a new age of available information where geolocated data per Instagram has allocated methods for outlier detection in practice for the early detection of unusual events in urban areas. Current approaches for detecting outliers using clustering techniques explore the relation of an outlier to the clusters in data. We present a novel clustering-based outlier detection algorithm (CCOD) that uses the notion of cooperative clustering towards better detection of outliers. This approach is based on assigning a cooperative outlier factor to each object and recognizing the set of candidate outliers after each merging step in the cooperative clustering model. The CCOD algorithm relies on the fact that cooperative clustering outperforms non-cooperative clustering to achieve better detection of outliers in the data. Experimentally, the CCOD is applied on both healthcare gene expression datasets and news text document datasets. Undertaken experimental results indicate that CCOD works better than the adopted traditional clustering-based outlier detection techniques with better improvement in the clustering quality after removing the identified set of outliers.", :title "Efficient anomaly detection using unsupervised cooperative machine learning", :keyword2 0, :authors (55501), :session 869}, 2899 {:keyword1 118, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Macroscopic models of traffic in cities have shown that for many networks a robust relationship exists between average vehicle flow and average vehicle density known as a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD).

We have developed a mathematical formulation to integrate FR in unit commitment (UC) problem. The proposed UC is a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MINLP), since it includes binary decision variables and also non-linear constraints which are expressed in terms of differential equations. We have employed mathematical techniques to transfer from a MINLP to a LP problem. To obtain the marginal prices from this non-convex optimization model, we have proposed the following methodologies. In the first method (Restricted Model), the MILP is solved with a GAMS solver and then based on the obtained solution, the binary variables are fixed to their optimal values and treated as real variables in the new problem. In the second method (Semi-Lagrangian or Fully Dispatchable Model), the MILP is linearized through relaxing the integer variables and allowing them to get values between zero and one. In reality this assumption is not true. However, it results in lower uplift payments in some cases. Investigating deeper this issue, we will study the total profit of each generating units. Therefore, based on the results for profits, there are some negative numbers among the amounts for profits.
