In addition to the cost-efficiency objective of the VSP-TW, our objective function considers the quality of a timetable from a passenger's point of view. Timetables are generated by balancing consecutive departures on a line according to predefined departure time intervals. We use a weighted sum approach to combine both objectives, namely costs of operation and quality of timetables. Our mathematical model and solution approach are based on efficient techniques known from the area of vehicle routing. A hybrid metaheuristic framework is proposed, which decomposes the problem into a scheduling and a balancing component. Real-world inspired instances allow for the evaluation of quality and performance of the solution approach. The proposed solution approach is able to outperform a commercial solver in terms of run time and solution quality.", :title "Integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling with balanced departure times", :keyword2 105, :authors (16919 15802), :session 58}, 8 {:keyword1 105, :keyword3 53, :abstract "Given passenger and freight trains with time windows and prespecified routes in a coarsened track network, operational train timetabling asks for feasible schedules of these trains that observe the time windows as well as station capacities and headway times. Freight trains typically have rather large time windows and their energy consumption mainly depends on the number of intermediate stops. Compared to cost functions that favor early arrival of trains, minimizing the total energy consumption over all trains should therefore lead to schedules that place freight trains in between the closely restricted passenger trains so that the number of stops is reduced significantly. We present computational results for real world instances of Deutsche Bahn and study the effect of taking energy consumption into account in the cost function.", :title "Minimizing Total Energy Consumption in Operational Train Timetabling", :keyword2 175, :authors (46464 17006), :session 324}, 9 {:keyword1 127, :keyword3 182, :abstract "The rule that 'prediction is very difficult, especially about the future' (Nils Bohr) not only applies in physics, but also in innovation management. Market introduction of a novel product constitutes a prominent example – the more so, if the planning horizon lies several years ahead and, consequently, information on customers' needs and/or preferences is scarce. More often than not, scenarios are used in such instances. They can be interpreted as descriptions of journeys to possible (multiple) 'futures' and provide indications on how current trends will unfold, what critical uncertainties will play out, and which factors will become relevant. Once developed, the corresponding 'pictures of the future' can be contrasted with potential (alternative) choices of action and discussed based on gut feelings and/or past experiences.\r\nIn our talk, we propose to enrich the decision basis with analyses gained from an agent-based (market) simulation that can separately be parameterized for each combination of a scenario and a portfolio of measures for furthering an innovation's market introduction. We have developed such a simulation for the domain of smart products. The corresponding (short-term) scenarios are provided by our cooperation partners from a joint research project embedded in the German Leading-Edge Cluster 'it's OWL'. The applicability as well as the transferability of this hybrid approach is sought to be demonstrated by means of two sample applications for industry partners from the cluster.

We consider the scenario where aircrafts are constrained to fly over a given airway network, which is prevalent on most airspaces. A simplified version of the problem can be formulated as a shortest-path problem, but a reasonably general model is highly non trivial to derive. This is partly due to state-dependent arc costs and complex air traffic rules.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce the problem and outline a novel algorithm that incorporates techniques from classical approaches for the Shortest Path Problem, Time Dependent Shortest Path Problem and Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem, as well as several heuristic approaches.

This allows for significant savings in energy costs as electricity contracts for big customers usually incorporate a price component that is proportional to the highest total power drawn at any given point in time. This power component accounts for up to 25 % of the total energy bill, which is as high as 1 billion Euros per year in the case of German railway traffic.\r\n\r\nWe start with a given raw timetable (before its publication) and shift the train departures at the stations within small time intervals of several minutes to come to the final timetable. This degree of freedom allows us to reduce the maximum power drawn from the catenaries within the planning horizon by desynchronizing too many simultaneous departures. At the same time, we synchronize accelerating trains with braking trains to make better use of the recuperated energy.\r\n\r\nOur models are mixed-binary programs with assignment structure whose constraints model the requirements of a feasible timetable. This includes safety constraints as well as constraints to ensure interchanges between the trains at the stations. In our study, we present a hierarchy of possible objective functions with respect to energy and power usage to fit the different needs of the involved players – mainly the railway transport companies and the railway infrastructure managers. We also discuss possible extensions of our approach to incorporate further real-world requirements.

In order to schedule each advertisement to the most suitable target audience, the number of TV viewers must be predicted for each 5 minute timeslot for multiple days in advance. However, viewership patterns vary by demographic of target audiences, from young adults to elderly couples and the affluent to the unemployed, across geo-regions from rainy North to sunny South, with TV programme schedules and weather driving viewership patterns over time. Consequently the forecasting task requires multivariate forecasting methods which are capable of handling high-frequency time series data in very large time series data. We propose to apply a multivariate k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm to TV viewership time series data. The algorithm is evaluated against a series of benchmark algorithms using UK data from a leading private UK TV channel using fixed-horizon multiple rolling origin evaluation, applying robust error measures in a valid and reliable experimental design.

More such free-flight regions are expected to emerge in the future. The computational challenge is to find a fuel-efficient trajectory that avoids head-winds and benefits from tail-winds, which change over the 4D space. The airplane‘s unit distance fuel consumption depends on its speed, weight, and altitude. Furthermore, the air traffic control cost is different for each country, so flying a longer detour over cheaper countries may pay off in total. Besides finding a trajectory, the total fuel consumption must be accurately computed.

The describing function method is used to predict limit cycle occurrence and their characteristics, such as frequency, amplitude and stability.\r\nFindings: Findings suggest that, even for an autonomous system, limit cycles occur.

Designers of this sort of service systems must take into consideration not only the disutility of an average user, but also the disutility of the worst situated user. Optimization of the average user disutility is related to the large weighted p-median problem. The necessity to solve large instances of the weighted p-median problem has led to the approximate approach based on a radial formulation, which enables to solve bigger instances in admissible time making use of a universal IP-solver. The p-median problem objective denoted as min-sum criterion often causes such situation that the average user´s disutility is minimal, but the disutility of the worst situated user can be extremely high, what is considered as unfair design. To mitigate this unfairness, we suggested two-phase method of the emergency service system design. The first phase consists of the process, when the disutility of the worst situated user is minimized making use of the radial formulation. The second phase is based on the above mentioned min-sum approach, where the result of the first phase is used to reduce the size of the radial model.

The goal is to estimate the replacement rate 1/µ where µ stands for the expected lifetime of an article.

As maximum likelihood methods are not applicable, the method for moments is implemented. But this method is not suitable for derivation of corresponding moments.

Conventional plant designs in large capacity scale suffer from large production batches and high investment risks. These production concepts are hardly able to cope with these volatile and uncertain demands. Therefore, modular production concepts implemented in standardized transportation iso-containers are currently in research focus. Due to a high level of standardization, the modular construction offers easily adjustable small scale plant designs with small production batches and a high degree of mobility. This leads to new opportunities regarding supply chain and network structure as a consequence of inherent mobility and scalability. Production locations can be placed directly in customer or resource proximity and plants can be relocated and adjusted in capacity over time in case of demand shifts. Hence, the structure of the production network can be dynamically adapted in accordance to current demands. At each decision step, container modules can either be added or removed from the network, relocated within the network, customers are (re-)allocated to container modules and new locations are set up or existing locations are closed. We propose mathematical optimization to minimize overall production network costs over a given time horizon such that entire customer demands are fulfilled.

We see that the choice of the leverage ratio determines whether or not one can find an impact of equity tax shields on the capital structure of firms. Precisely, equity tax shields reduce the long-term liabilities to assets ratio and on the long-term liabilities to long-term capital ratio, but have no impact on the total liabilities to assets ratio. Although the Austrian system granted only a rather small dose of equity tax shields, we find that the tax regime achieved its goal to reduce the leverage (ignoring short-term liabilities). Interestingly, even though it is the book value capital structure that determines the size of equity tax shields, this effect was slightly stronger and more significant for the capital structure at market values than for the book value capital structure. We find that the government could influence the capital structure by changing the level of the equity interest rate allowed. We observe that small firms reduced their capital structure more in response to equity tax shields than big firms. Similarly, we find that firms that were included in the Austrian Traded Index (ATX) did not react to equity tax shields. By contrast, firms that were not included in the ATX strongly reacted to the equity tax shields. Moreover, we find that financial firms did not react to the equity tax shields whereas non-financial firms showed at least some reaction.

In the debt renegotiation process, the shareholders arrange the coupon reduction and use equity financing to retire a part of the debt value to the debt holders. The timing of debt restructuring always coincides with that of liquidation without debt renegotiation.

Furthermore, the trip must be cancelled in the timetable. \r\nThe development of a decision support system that considers the three resource schedules simultaneously was one of the key goals of the ON-TIME project.

Routing preprocessing typically relies on partitioning the street network while minimizing the number of roads crossing the partition, whereas modular maps are typically organized in rectangular tiles. When updating one part of a for routing preprocessed partition all overlapping rectangular tiled data clusters have to be transmitted. Considering this, it is likely that some of the data sent to the devices in tiled data clusters are redundant because they are not covered by the routing area. Even though sending data is costly due to limited bandwidths for data transmission to mobile devices, this problem is not covered by the literature so far.\r\nThe goal of this paper consists in gaining insight into the relation between tiled partitions and routing partitions.

The scheme consists of an allocation of products to units and a periodic production sequence, called a cycle, for each unit.  Thus, four decisions have to be made: First, all products have to be allocated to a unit in each stage. Second, it is decided how often a product is processed per cycle. Third, the production sequence in the cycle has to be determined. Finally, for a given lot sizing strategy the time provided for each lot has to be specified.

A widely used benchmark for measuring the efficiency of NPOs is the overhead cost ratio, consisting of the total money spent on administration and fundraising relative to the budget. Such easily accessible measurements face severe criticism, since variations of overhead costs are not necessarily linked to changes in the impact achieved. Additionally, the focus on such information can lead to increasing pressure to reduce expenses, with potential negative effects on administrative capacities. Unlike fundraising expenses, administrative costs do not help advertise the actions of an NPO, but account for the majority of overhead costs. Reducing administrative expenses is a logical consequence from a financial viewpoint and might, hence, not only negatively affect NPOs but also beneficiaries. This phenomenon is known as \"Nonprofit Starvation Cycle\". This work provides an analytical framework for analyzing NPO decision making concerning administrative costs. It builds upon a compound utility function, containing budget and impact maximizing properties. The paper provides answers to important recent research questions on the optimal level of administrative spending, the influencing factors and the effects of available information on NPOs and beneficiaries.

Network expansion comprises several alternatives for the new transformers, feeders, DG and charging stations. The optimal expansion plan selects the best alternative, location and stage for each asset. The model is a multistage stochastic programing minimizing the net present value of the overall costs, which contains investment, maintenance, production, losses and unserved energy costs. The motivation of this proposal is to incentive distributor planners in the current situation driven by the increased penetration of DG and EV in order to invest efficiently. This model explicitly uses uncertainty from demand and renewable energy sources. A k-means clustering technique is proposed to address this uncertainty maintaining the correlation between load, wind and photovoltaic generation. EVs have become quite significant due to the increased social awareness of environmental issues and the desire to rely on fossil fuels. For this reason, optimal siting and sizing of charging stations are taken into account in the optimal planning. Moreover, the model can allocate charging capacity among candidate charging station sites optimally and expand an existing one. Another feature is that, with the new penetration of DG, radiality constraints related to fictitious demands are incorporated into the model. Also, the cost of energy losses is linearized by a piecewise linear approximation so the formulation is a mixed integer lineal programming (MILP) in order to guarantee optimality.

A major challenge arises from the fact that the majority of vehicles have to be brought from relatively few plants and vehicle compounds to widespread dealer locations, where it is particularly difficult to quickly find a suitable next load near to where a truck has dropped its last vehicle. As a result, the empty mile factor in North America is estimated to be as high as 42%, whereas it ranges between 12% and 17% in the general freight sector. There are two main strategies to improve the auto-carriers' utilization. Especially large companies can take advantage of their network and route trucks to the next compound for the next load instead of returning them to where it started.

Because sold seats cannot be offered again opportunity costs are considered to minimize the risk of spoilage by having to reject high yield customers due to overselling at low rates. Simultaneously the passenger's willingness to pay is evaluated to control for price elasticity cost. Those may occur if a seat is sold for a fare which is below the individual’s willingness to pay. This presentation will focus on the latter. We propose to exploit the demand-price-relationship to capture the price elasticity cost by the fare which maximizes revenue. A comparison of a discrete and continuous pricing-scheme is done to show that the maximum may not be achievable by an airline which uses booking classes as not every fare-value is available for pricing. As proposed within the literature estimation of the demand-price-equation may give a downward biased price influence as price could depend itself upon demand. This would mean that we would falsely assume a less price elastic demand. In order to identify the potential endogeneity three approaches are benchmarked. Our reference, ignoring the endogenity issue, is given by a flexible approach which relaxes the assumption of a specific functional form by implementing unspecified but smooth functions.

Due to the volatile and stochastic characteristic of the renewable feed-in and residual power demand, the need for highly flexible, but cost-efficient power plant operations arises. Energy storages, mainly hydro storages, are a promising mean to support these flexible requirements by smoothing the residual demand for thermal power plants. Scheduling and coordinating power plants and energy storages results in the well-known Unit Commitment Problem with hydro-thermal coordination (UCP-HT), which typically relies on a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To substantially reduce the computational effort of the MILP, we present a two-stage heuristic approach for the UCP-HT. The first stage preselects certain plants to fulfill the fluctuating residual demand and spinning reserve requirements without using any energy storages. Moreover, several techno-economic parameters like power output specifications, minimum up- and down-times or time-dependent startup costs are taken into account. A greedy algorithm is hereby applied to get a first solution, which will be stepwise enhanced by local optimization. The second stage improves this solution in consideration of energy storages.

Indeed, the reformulation of (QEP) as an optimization problem brings some difficult issues which are not met in the EP case: the gap function is not necessarily differentiable even though the equilibrium and the constraining bifunctions are; the feasible region is given by the fixed points of the set-valued constraining map and is therefore more difficult to handle; the so-called stationarity property, which guarantees all the stationary points of the gap function to be solutions of (QEP) requires monotonicity assumptions both on the equilibrium and constraining bifunctions. \r\nThese issues are dealt with in the talk. After the gap function has been introduced, its smoothness properties are analysed; in particular, an upper estimate of its Clarke directional derivative is given, which provides a key tool in devising the descent method.

For investment planning, the economically optimal capacity of the flexibility investment over its entire lifetime has to be determined.\r\nDue to increasing uncertainties regarding the development of the DER system, the investment’s lifetime is divided into two sections: The planning horizon is determined as the time period for which uncertainty can be modeled with scenarios.

Primarily aiming at the reduction of manufacturing planning and execution complexity, leveling of capacity loads, and reduction of WIP-inventories, a central goal one often hears is the reduction of setup times to reduce lot sizes —in the best case, to realize a “one piece flow”. The current prevalent approach for one piece flow is through implementation of control procedures like KANBAN or CONWIP and not in a shop’s planning and scheduling procedures. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate how integrating one piece flow into the planning and scheduling of production can be accomplished via lot streaming. We argue that job shop scheduling with full lot streaming can compensate well-known drawbacks of MRP —i.e., unlimited capacity and fixed planned lead times— and simultaneously attain the benefits expected by a one piece flow. We study a general job shop whose jobs represent lots of product items with the lot size the same for each of the job’s operations. Thereby, we permit overlapping of operations but prohibit interruption of operation processing, calling this “full lot streaming”. Instead of lot splitting, we assure a feasible overlapping of operations by minimal time lags (based on the transfer batch size) between the start times of two consecutive operations. With this approach, a transfer batch size equal to one leads to a one piece flow and provides a type of lower bound on the minimum flow time (inventory) necessary to produce a given product demand.

In job scheduling, it can be shown that minimization of makespan and flowtime yields more variable inter-departure times of jobs (Leisten/Rajendran (2015)). Therefore the link between approaches of (stochastic) queuing theory and (static-deterministic) job scheduling approaches is subject of current research. We start with an ‘ideal’ scheduling problem where all jobs have the same processing times on all machines, i.e. there is no processing time variability. As a consequence, no time, capacity or inventory buffers are required. Instead, a real-world system requires an efficient (non-zero) mix of these buffers to balance the influence of non-uniformity. In the scheduling context, inventory buffers are interpreted as waiting time of jobs whereas capacity buffers are seen as idle time of machines. The focus here is to observe the effects of non-uniform processing times on performance measures in a scheduling system, i.e. makespan, flowtime, waiting/idle time. As a reference system, a permutation flow shop is used to illustrate the influence of variability of processing times. Experimentally, non-uniform processing times are smoothed so that the total processing times of jobs and/or machines converge to the same average value. To achieve this, two different modification approaches are analyzed. The first model uses the Kullback-Leibler-Divergence for a logarithmic objective function, the second model uses the statistical least-square-method for a quadratic objective function.

This allows pooling resources and at the same time leveling out the associated overall bed occupancy levels including seasonality effects. The objective function is cost-based and minimizes the additional management and personnel qualification costs due to patient pooling effects as well as all costs associated to holding the required bed capacity available.

From a computational point of view this problem is intractable, even for m=1. Since the problem is defined on inputs of various information, we study the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem. The idea behind fixed-parameter tractability is to split the complexity into two parts - one part that depends purely on the size of the input, and one part that depends on some parameter of the problem that tends to be small in practice. We show that for our problem the number of instruments, the threshold value of the return, and the sum of all capacities can be chosen as a parameter such that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable.

To provide insights about the design of effective and efficient granular solution methods for routing problems with time windows, we conduct extensive numerical experiments with a granular tabu search (GTS) for the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). \r\nWe find that sparsification methods using reduced-cost values based on the solution of a linear relaxation of the original problem outperform standard sparsification methods.

Therefore, transportation contracts defining all frame conditions for different transportation networks determine one or more percentage rates of trains or kilometers that have to be attended by conductors.

After solving the restricted master problem with an initial schedule, dual values are used to generate new feasible duties iteratively (pricing problem). The most common approach to solve the pricing problem is to find a shortest path according to resource constraints. As we have to find good crew schedules for planning periods of two weeks or even one month in a few hours in practice, we present a genetic algorithm as a faster solution approach for the pricing problem.

Relevant, sequence-dependant changeovers are considered. An integer, combined lot-sizing and scheduling model is formulated. The model is based on a novel approach by transforming and modifying the distance-constrained vehicle routing problem (DCVRP) for levelling purposes. Four target criteria of levelling are identified. These involve changeover times, smoothness of daily workload, variance of lot-sizes and similarity of production sequences. The latter has been modeled with a modified version of the Hamming-distance. The criteria are integrated into different target functions and solved to optimality with Gurobi.\r\n\r\nRandom scenarios are generated to evaluate the target functions. The results reveal that a proposed multi-criteria target function outperforms all other target functions. The impact of a variation of the weighting factors, a reduction of the available capacity and the length of the levelling period is analyzed.

One major disadvantage of the classical approach is that each DMU optimizes its individual weighting scheme--often called self-appraisal. To overcome this flaw cross-efficiency evaluation has been developed as an alternative way of efficiency evaluation and ranking of DMUs, cf. Sexton (1986) or Doyle and Green (1994). Here all individual weighting schemes--called price systems--are applied to the activities of all DMUs.

With our approach we optimize the traffic routing without determining optimal routes for every evacuee. In the developed method, the street network for a given traffic flow is optimized. With the blockage of street segments we reach an improvement of traffic distribution what leads to a better traffic flow and results in a faster evacuation.

For instance, in agricultural industries, calculated amounts of peat and fertilizer, which are used to raise plants, can only be realized within some accuracy. Uncertainty in decision variables in single-objective optimization problems is addressed by regularization robustness, see, e.g., Lewis 2002.\r\n\r\nIn our talk, we present an extension of the framework of single-objective regularization robustness to multi-objective optimization.

This simulation software offers a lot of features such as material-removal simulation and collision detection during the production process. These features are associated with a sharp increase in the simulation complexity level which leads to a high level of effort for a simple simulation-based optimization approach where a high number of iterations are typically necessary to evaluate the optimization results. This contribution describes the research project’s current results focusing on how to implement the machine setup optimization in a way that is practical and useful for industrial application for cutting machines. The contribution takes into account an asynchronous execution of a population-based optimization technique which reaches a faster near-optimal simulation result. A  preprocessing system for the evaluation of the optimization results which consists of a fitness interface and a NC-parser was developed for this purpose to avoid needless simulation runs of the virtual tooling machine in order to achieve time savings for the work preparation process and resources.", :title "Machine Configuration via Simulation-Based Optimization", :keyword2 48, :authors (48758 38541), :session 266}, 519 {:keyword1 57, :keyword3 157, :abstract "Necmettin Erbakan University is a new but fast developed one.

New types of loads (shiftable, curtailable), as well as the existence of distributed generation units pose new challenges, while advances in the Information and Communication Technologies provide new opportunities for the network and its users (Operator, retailers, prosumers). Smart meters are seen as a means for enabling customers having a better control over their electricity bills and for helping the retailer in the process of data gathering. More importantly, they constitute an invaluable ally for facilitating the pricing task of the retailer, reflecting more efficiently the true cost of electricity.\r\nPrice signals made available through in-home displays are expected to affect the behavior of the distribution network users in a way difficult to predict using existing tools (e.g. load forecasting). In attempting to participate in the retail market cost-efficiently, the electricity retailer needs to incorporate such a complex environment in its operations. The question that arises is: at what level should the retail price be set and what form the pricing scheme should have in order to induce the consumers in a behavior optimal both for them and for the retailer?\r\nIn order to answer this question we first identify the hierarchical decision-making process underlying the aforementioned interaction between electricity retailer and consumer. We, then, formulate a bilevel programming problem (BLPP) that enables testing a variety of pricing schemes.

As the urban area can be divided into different hazardous areas, the objective is to minimize the suffered hazard for the evacuees. The results are the evacuation routes and the assignment of the evacuees to these routes. One major problem of these evacuation plans is that the main (=fastest or safest) evacuation routes are mostly utilized up to the capacity limit. Thus a potential street capacity drop, caused by the disaster itself or traffic accidents, could lead to great complication in the entire evacuation process. We overcome this problem by introducing the aspect of resilience to evacuation planning and define an evacuation plan as more resilient, if a capacity drop has no significant impact on the evacuation process.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of resilience is implemented by utilizing the available capacities of the street network as balanced as possible. Therefore we present a new bi-objective path-based evacuation model. We cope with the two conflicting objective functions by applying the Epsilon-Constraint Method.

As the determination of such proper evacuation paths (with detours) represents a tricky problem, we introduce a special Path Generation Algorithm.

In a long-term perspective order promising does not only aim at short-term profit maximization but simultaneously at reaching an appropriate level of reliability. In the literature capable-to-promise (CTP) approaches are proposed to submit offers based on the present order and resource situation. A broad spectrum of measures to cover order- and resource-related uncertainty is considered in the CTP literature, but so far proposing alternative order specifications has not been focused in research. In particular, customer response to monetary as well as to non-monetary order specifications is not adequately taken into account. Therefore, the intension of the planned paper is to develop a CTP approach which aims at obtaining reliable planning results by proposing alternative order specifications that differ from customer requirements in price and delivery date. For this purpose a two-stage planning approach is derived: At the first planning stage orders are accepted if they can be fulfilled according to customer specifications in a profitable way. All other orders are provisionally rejected and re-planning is done at the second stage. Thereby deviating order specifications are determined which increase the profitability of provisionally rejected orders and may be acceptable for the customers. For this reason customer response to later delivery dates and reduced prices is anticipated by an estimated acceptance probability. In order to investigate the impacts of adjusting delivery dates and prices on generated profits as well as the reliability of planning results the planning approach is numerically analyzed based on real-world data.", :title "Reliable order promising with multidimensional anticipation of customer response", :keyword2 91, :authors (39472 26613), :session 390}, 535 {:keyword1 91, :keyword3 95, :abstract "Optimizing an airline schedule usually comprises multiple planning stages. These are the choice of flights to offer (schedule design), the assignment of fleets to flight legs (fleet assignment), and the construction of rotations under consideration of maintenance constraints (aircraft maintenance routing). Moreover, the airline must assign crews to all flights (crew scheduling). Traditionally, these scheduling stages are either solved sequentially or an existing schedule is modified in order to cope with the arising complexity issue. More recently, some authors have developed models that integrate adjacent stages. In this paper, we consider the case of a small to medium-sized point-to-point airline with a homogeneous fleet. Hence, fleet assignment is omitted, which offers the possibility to solve schedule design and aircraft maintenance routing simultaneously.

In contrast to classic Benders Decomposition the subproblems in LBBD are not restricted to linear programs. LBBD has already been applied with great success on various problems including the strip packing problem. We propose a new LBBD-approach for the 3-staged Strip Packing Problem (3SSPP), in which two-dimensional rectangular items have to be arranged onto a rectangular strip of fixed width, such that the items can be obtained by three stages of guillotine cuts while the required strip height is to be minimized.  In the first stage the strip is cut horizontally into levels, in the second stage the levels are vertically subdivided into stacks, and cutting the stacks horizontally results in the items. The restriction to three stages of guillotine cuts is common in industry due to limitations in the manufacturing process. Our LBBD master problem assigns items to levels and within each level for all items of the same width the number of stacks to be used is determined. The actual partitioning of items into stacks is done in the subproblems, which are related to multiprocessor scheduling problems. For a LBBD to be efficient, it is essential that the Benders cuts generated from the subproblems are as general as possible. We apply two techniques. The subproblem is solved multiple times with a decreasing number of items in order to find a smallest set of items that still requires the same height as the original set.

Modeled as a Markov decision process, these complex options, unlike standard options, come with both a high-dimensional exogenous and endogenous state and vector-valued decisions and hence suffer from all three curses of dimensionality together. The common industry approach to valuate standard options is the so-called least squares Monte-Carlo method, a form of approximate value iteration, which uses simulated price paths as sample locations both to evaluate the Bellman operator in and to approximate the expectation; and uses least squares regression to represent the value function iterates in terms of a monomial (or other) basis. The approach we present here on the other hand is built around approximate policy iteration and solves a projected form of the Bellman equation in a regularized kernel ridge regression setting.

Whereas the recycling rates of steel, aluminum, and lead are considerably high, the cost-effective recycling of rare earth materials is still a challenge. Companies in that respect are increasingly faced by securing a steady stream of supply of critical and conflict raw materials for their production. Due to increasing unreliability of supply (e.g. due to legislative restrictions, social conditions) and volatility of prices including the required amount of raw materials also from recycling options in the procurement process is advisable. To improve the economic and environmental sustainability and the resource efficiency of the mentioned products it is necessary to analyze technical as well as supply chain processes of recycling critical and conflict materials. In this paper we investigate a dual sourcing strategy where critical materials can be procured on the one hand from a primary raw materials supplier, i.e. directly from the mine and, on the other hand, from recycled materials as a secondary source. Hence, we take into account flows of new and returned materials simultaneously. Considering uncertain prices for primary materials, uncertain yield rate from product returns and uncertain demand for the finished product as well as their potential dependencies we develop a single period inventory model to derive the order quantities of recycled and primary materials by optimizing the economic and the environmental performance.", :title "Integrating dual sourcing with recycling options for the procurement of critical and conflict materials", :keyword2 31, :authors (37248 46997 2391), :session 221}, 557 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 151, :abstract "Mechanism design with agents who are not quasi-linear is an important\r\nline of research.

This paper analyzes the valuation and pricing of physical electricity delivery contracts from the viewpoint of a producer with fixed production possibilities and storage capacity. Using stochastic optimization problems in discrete time with general state space, the duals of production problems are used to derive no-arbitrage conditions for fuel and electricity prices as well as superhedging values and prices of OTC electricity delivery contracts. In particular we take the perspective of an electricity producer, serving contractual deliveries but avoiding unacceptable losses at the end of the planning horizon. The resulting no-arbitrage conditions, stochastic discount factors and superhedging prices account for typical frictions like limitation of storage and production capacity and for the fact that it is possible to produce electricity from fuel, but not to produce fuel from electricity. Similarities, but also substantial differences to purely financial results can be demonstrated in this way.

To represent a solution of the strip packing problem, a solution of the horizontal bar relaxation has to satisfy, among others, the vertical contiguous condition. That means there must exist such an ordering of the 1D cutting patterns that all items representing one rectangle are located in consecutive patterns.

The algorithm is based on the discrete dynamic programming and Bellman’s backward approach. The objective function is to minimize the energy consumption, i.e. having the maximum battery level left at the end of the trip. The constraints are the trip time, battery capacity, local speed limits and limitations on the traction motor. Time is the independent variable and distance, velocity and battery level are the state variables. All of the four variables are discretized which results in some inaccuracy in the calculations, which is discussed in the paper.

The bidders are heterogeneous in their experience, so that more experienced contractors have a cost advantage and, additionally, they are able to more accurately estimate the project cost. Besides, winning a project results in an experience increase. The Markov perfect equilibrium of this sequential game is heuristically approximated by a best response mechanism. We experimentally show that the introduction of a pipeline results in fiercer competition from a mark-up perspective. Nevertheless, including future project opportunities does not necessarily lead to a greater investment willingness. Consequently, triggering the increased bid proposal efforts might require the introduction of bid cost reimbursements. The study also reports on the findings from a laboratory experiment with 180 business students in this PPP setup. The students consistently underbid compared to the theoretical equilibrium, which inflates the risk of default.", :title "A sequential bidding model for public-private partnerships: theory versus laboratory", :keyword2 86, :authors (36770 41246), :session 218}, 608 {:keyword1 40, :keyword3 134, :abstract "In our paper we expand the considerations of Fandel/Trockel (2011) to an analysis of a dynamic trust behavior of the strategic players. The trust parameters that determine the level of the additional payoffs in the case of trust are now time-dependent with respect to the number of repeated rounds of the inspection game. The basis of modelling is a logistic function that describes the trust expansion among the strategic players. Unfortunately there exists the hazard that the inspectee will prey the inspector’s trust if the inspector’s trust level increases and exceeds a threshold. The inspector wants to prevent this situation. This is modelled by a stochastic term which expresses the percentual loss of trust of the inspector that may occur, so that a reasonable boundary of a threatened exploitation is not realized. However if this occurs, the calculated equilibrium in the next round of the repeated game will be the Nash solution without any trust. In the following rounds trust will maybe increase again and develop in a similar way as before.\r\nBased on a simulated structure of the chronology of the players’ payoffs one can estimate the level of mistrust the inspector should never underbid, so that error-free payoff-series without trust variations occur that dominate the Nash solution in games without trust, but simultaneously decrease the value of hazard the inspector may be exploited by the inspectee.", :title "The effects of trust variations on inspection procedures", :keyword2 101, :authors (16883 16887), :session 401}, 610 {:keyword1 156, :keyword3 95, :abstract "We consider the problem of finding the optimal routing of a single vehicle that starts its route from a depot and delivers a product to N customers that are served according to a particular order.

Most optimization procedures are based on deterministic modelling in the sense that they do not take into account the uncertainties on environmental conditions (e.g., wind) and on air traffic control operations. However, aircraft performance in a real-world context are highly sensitive to these uncertainties.\r\nThe aim of this work is twofold. First we provide some numerical evidence of the sensitivity of fuel consumption and flight duration with respect to random fluctuations of the wind and the air traffic control operations. The presented numerical simuations rely on in-service aircraft performance models. These numerical results extend earlier works (cf. B.Schwartz et al. 2000) that only studied a single source of uncertainty.\r\nSecond, we develop a global stochastic optimization procedure for general aircraft performance criteria. The goal is to minimize a certain expected cost associated to the trajectory in the random environment. This problem is a non-convex optimization problem. Since we consider general (black-box) cost functions, we develop a derivative-free optimization procedure: adaptive simulated annealing with homogenization (A.S.A.H.) in the same spirit as in T.M.Alkhamis et al. 1997. At each iteration, our algorithm uses several Monte Carlo evaluations of the noisy cost function. A key ingredient is to increase the number of evaluations of the cost function with the number of iterations. We relate the accuracy of the cost function to the temperature parameter of the A.S.A.H. algorithm to obtain good performance of the method.

The actual simulation model is then generated based on the given input data.  SimChain is a first simulation tool which offers model building and the execution of simulation experiments as a cloud service. However, it is based on a single user concept for a simulation project. In this presentation we focus on possible approaches for shared model building and evaluation in order to overcome the problems which result from requirements of concealing individual data. Our approach is based on a complex authentication concept which allows participants to hide internal data from other participants, but to simultaneously allow the usage of the data for detailed simulation models and the presentation of (limited) statistics for the entire supply chain. A three-level concept for data usage and the respective level of detail of publishing results is presented on the basis of the data model of SimChain.\r\n", :title "Supply chain simulation in the cloud: Shared model building and result analysis with respect to requirements for concealing individual input data", :keyword2 101, :authors (45360 49097), :session 174}, 653 {:keyword1 59, :keyword3 8, :abstract "Biopharmaceutical manufacturing requires high investments and long-term production planning. For large biopharma companies, planning typically requires assigning quantities of multiple products  to several production facilities over time, leading to large and complex scheduling problems. Production is usually done in batches with a substantial set-up cost and time for switching between products, and the goal of satisfying demand while minimizing manufacturing, set-up and inventory costs. The resulting production planning problem is a complicated variant of the capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem, over multiple facilities and multiple products. Inspired by evolutionary algorithm approaches to job shop scheduling, this paper proposes a tailored construction heuristic that schedules demands of multiple products sequentially across several facilities to build a multi-year production plan (solution). The sequence in which the construction heuristic schedules the different demands is optimized by an evolutionary algorithm.

As a result, timetables with possible conflicts in those covered railway stations will be computed. Consequently, there is the need for efficient algorithms and its corresponding conjunction to solve the remaining conflicts, such as detecting alternative stopping positions and routes within a main railway station and the optimized selection.

Nevertheless, it is indispensable to control the mine water levels, as the mine water must be strictly kept separate from the sediment layers carrying the ground water. Hence mine water must not exceed a predefined safety margin. Being the responsible party for the termination of subsidized coal mining in Germany, RAG uses wells to control the mine water levels in the old shafts. The maintenance costs for these wells are among the largest expenses faced by the RAG. The wells of the old mines offer the possibility to use underground flood detention basins. These flood detention basins can be used as storage facilities to minimize electrical energy costs of safeguarding the wells. In this study, we investigate how pump control optimized with respect to the prevailing electricity prices impacts the operating costs. The mathematical optimization of the well takes the dependency of electrical power with the heaved water volume and the changing water level into account. The nonlinear dependency is transformed into a linear optimization problem in multiple stages. First, a superstructure optimization is used. Subsequently, the characteristic pump profiles are linearized piecewise, resulting in a simplified problem where only the multiplication of a binary and a positive real variable remain. The multiplication of the two variables is replaced by a new variable; this way, the optimization problem is converted to a mixed integer linear optimization (MILP) problem.

Since there are many uncertainties about carbon leakage it is of interest to compare the different results of those studies concerning the height of the carbon leakage rate as well as its influence factors. Thus it is useful to perform a meta-analysis. It consists of 39 of those studies and uses a regression model which employs parameters like the size of the countries abating as well as Armington or supply elasticities of fossil fuels. The purpose of this is to estimate the rate of carbon leakage. The results imply that the predicted carbon leakage rates differ substantially among those studies. Further results indicate that an extension of the EU ETS (EU 11% of global CO2 emissions) on EU and China (39% of global CO2 emissions) would reduce the leakage rates in the model by about 8%. An extension to Annex 1 and China (70% of global CO2 emissions) would almost solve the leakage problem. A reduction of about 18% could be achieved in the model while the average leakage rate of 39 studies is about 20%. Those factors have already been widely discussed in the literature.

Due to the loading processes on their routes, the assignment can result in blocked trucks, increasing the total transit time at the terminal. The transportation between client and terminal is outsourced to external contractors. Therefore, the transport costs will increase when the total transit time exceeds a particular threshold. Thus, reducing the waiting time increases client satisfaction.

The goal of these models is to develop recommendations for the long-term configuration of bike sharing systems which consists of the number and location of stations, their capacities and the size of the bike fleet.\r\nTo ensure that the resulting systems also suffice operative requirements, the models integrate the hourly movements of the system users as well as dynamic and static repositioning activities of the system operator. The latter are necessary to compensate for asymmetrical bike flows by transporting excess bikes from full to empty stations.\r\nThe models are solved for different, partially conflicting objective functions. The system operator aims at minimal investment costs for the system erection and a maximum operative result (difference between user fees and operational costs). In comparison, the system users require a sufficient coverage of their origins and destinations as well as a demand-oriented availability of rentable bikes. The models use penalty costs to evaluate these aspects and minimize the resulting costs. Moreover, the different perspectives are simultaneously considered by a combined approach to further enhance the system’s viability.\r\nThe models are solved by a standard solver for a fictitious application example.

Three important planning criteria are balance, compactness and contiguity. Balance describes the requirement for districts to have approximately the same size with respect to a quantifiable activity measure, e.g. sales potential or working time. A district is said to be geographically compact if it is closely and firmly packed together, e.g. nearly round-shaped or square and undistorted.

Basing on a distribution structure with a central omni-channel distribution center (DC) and a set of bricks-and-mortar stores, the program supports the decisions, when to allocate how many items to the stores and the omni-channel DC. Additionally the optimal pricing policy for the discount phase is selected. We solve the problem for a dual-channel setting on a single SKU basis, taking into account the relevant phase-specific cost components. Finally, we apply the suggested solution approach to a real life case of a European fashion retailer and provide sensitivity analyses to gain managerial insights.

However, in real-time operations of robotic cells there are different sources of stochasticity, for example wafer alignment processes or variances in processing times. Using deterministic schedules in a stochastic environment will often times lead to deadlocks or violations of wafer delay constraints and will therefore make a schedule which is generated on the assumption of deterministic processing times infeasible. Thus, this talk considers the real-time scheduling of robotic cells in semiconductor manufacturing with stochastic processing times and robot task times. We aim at deriving makespan-optimal sequences when activity times are subjected to stochastic variance. For this reason, we develop a hierarchic approach for schedule generation and schedule execution which allows that wafer delay constraints are ensured and high wafer throughput is maintained.

For the determination of change in value of a network-entrance by emerging path-dependency, a fuzzy approach will be used for evaluation and thus giving decision support. For this purpose, a fuzzy version of the Datar-Mathews approach will be applied, once with and once without considering path-dependent processes. The use of the Datar-Mathews approach first relaxes the stringent assumption of evaluation via an escapist riskless market interest rate. Instead, according to network-specific characteristics and in relation to the exercise date of the examined options, differentiated interest rates are used. In addition, the effects of arising path-dependency on the payoff distribution and, hence, the corresponding realoption-value of a project can be examined by applying a fuzzy methodology. Thereto, we can use fuzzy numbers and intervals as well as linguistic variables. Fuzzy numbers and intervals are employed for arithmetical calculation, linguistic variables for rule-based determination of the option-value. Whereat, the corresponding fuzzy factors can refer to all determinants of the option-value (e.g. cashflows, scenario probabilities).\r\nIn terms of work in progress we continue our last year’s topic “Evaluating path-dependency in networks – a fuzzy realoption approach” and extend it by in depth considerations concerning a fuzzificated Datar-Mathews approach.\r\n", :title "Deeper insights in the use of a fuzzificated Datar-Mathews approach", :keyword2 18, :authors (42931 2651), :session 258}, 789 {:keyword1 174, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Containers drayage involves the delivery of a full container from an intermodal terminal to a receiver and the following collection of an empty container, as well as the provision of an empty container to the shipper and the subsequent transportation of a full trailer or container to the intermodal terminal. \r\nMost of the practical problems as well as researches related to the container drayage problem deal with the routing and scheduling of container vehicles only, where it is implicitly assumed that customer nodes, both pickup and delivery (P/D), are equipped with appropriate container handling equipment able to load or unload container. However, in real world systems some customer nodes, usually smaller companies, may have container P/D requests, although they are not equipped with appropriate handling equipment. For such a customer nodes service provider may leave containers on trailers until they are loaded or unloaded, or customer may rent appropriate handling device to perform container loading or unloading operation. In the second case, to avoid waiting of P/D vehicles it is needed to synchronize moments when vehicle and rented handling device arrive at customer nodes. When the P/D vehicle in a single route have to visit few nodes which are not equipped with appropriate handling devices, arises the problem of simultaneous routing both, vehicles and handling devices so that their arrivals at customer nodes are synchronized.  \r\nIn this paper we address the problem and propose mixed integer linear model to determine optimal synchronized routes of vehicles and handling devices performing containers’ P/D operations.\r\n", :title "Containers drayage problem with simultaneous routing of vehicles and handling equipment", :keyword2 158, :authors (43678 49152 49154), :session 63}, 791 {:keyword1 59, :keyword3 104, :abstract "We consider the base stations location problem.

Follower can set up his base stations on a free sites, or use the leaders base stations to deploy his antennas as well as on the sites, occupied by the leader. In the latter case the follower have to pay the rent price. After the deployment of all base stations, users sign a contract with the leaders or followers network. The choice of each user is dependant of the average quality of the network. The quality of a signal between the user and the base station depends on distance, noise and interference. Noise in the band together with an interference between base stations decreases the power of signal. We assume, that traffic demand is a constant in the network that operators wish to serve. In every location there is a certain demand, generated by users. This demand is statistical and can be shared by the leader and the follower or not served at all.

Selling prices for spot and term are based on fluctuating daily average industry prices plus a mark-up resulting in around 50% higher spot than term prices.  For any customer, signing a yearly framework agreement is required in order to buy under a term contract. This agreement defines monthly quantities to be fulfilled by both the buyer and the seller. Customers place orders for diesel and pick it within a specified time window. If the company has sufficient diesel available for selling, customers can also buy and pick the product on the spot market on the same day without any long term contractual agreement. Currently any term quantity sold is reserved until it is picked by the customer. However, company statistics show that around 50% of orders are picked after the replenishment lead time. Therefore, sales to spot market customers could be increased by overbooking on-hand inventory instead of reserving it for term customers. \r\n\r\nIn this paper we propose a revenue management model for a combined make-to-order and make-to-stock environment in the process industry.

In such systems, early detection and reliable tracking are crucial for assessing the impact of aircraft behavior. At VHF band, radar cross section of an aircraft is larger than at higher frequencies, making detection easier. Due to this, and their cost-effectiveness, VHF radars are desirable in some air surveillance applications. Contemporary VHF radars are usually equipped with solid-state transmitters (SST) and employ pulse-Doppler (PD) processing. Typically, low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) regime is chosen, ensuring unambiguous range measurements, while Doppler ambiguities are inevitable, which leads to existence of blind speeds. To mitigate this problem, multiple PRFs must be used within a dwell. Low peak power inherent to SST requires the use of long pulses to achieve acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for long distance target returns, which causes significant range eclipsing. This can be compensated by interleaving short pulses, which cause acceptable range eclipsing, with long ones. Thus, to ensure coverage of all ranges and velocities of interest, a complex waveform is required. For a set number of coherent processing intervals (CPI) within a dwell, and assuming that pulse durations are same in all CPIs, design variables determining the PD waveform are pulse durations, and PRFs for each CPI. Design goals are increasing the SNR, efficient mitigation of blind speeds and increasing Doppler resolution. We show that design goals are conflicting with respect to variation of design variables, and that a multiobjective approach is needed to find the optimal design.

Practically all arable land is already used, and it is split between food production and biofuels. The complementary problems is related to deforestation and water scarcity. Functional dependence between forested area and fresh water is assumed. In a simple model (without water) technological progress in agriculture allows to satisfy the food demand of growing population. The oil supply is modeled with Hubbert-type curve that describes oil peak. Exponential growth of both population and agricultural productivity is assumed. Biofuels emerge before oil peak, when marginal cost of oil extraction exceeds the cost of agricultural production. With constant land in use and growing oil scarcity, less land will be used for food production and more for biofuels. The second model adds water and forested area. It considers the positive link between forested area and available water and includes a possibility of partial deforestation. In this case the total arable land may grow, but global agriculture will face water scarcity, both for production of food and biofuels. Partial deforestation can make transition from oil to biofuels less painful. But the major problem in future will be satisfaction of personal water demand. The price of water grows in time to meet growing demand. For low water prices this will increase both food and energy production until water supply is sufficient. If the time of global water and oil scarcity will coincide, there will be complex interaction between these two processes. Those processes are regional since water is not globally tradable.

(2) The demand is met by the deployment of driver types with different driving skills and their assignment to different vehicle types. (3) Regarding driving hours a comprehensive legislation has to be considered. One opportunity to handle these challenges is the generation of flexibly usable sets of shifts. On the one hand the flexibility of a set is determined by the number and type of included shifts. On the other hand it will be limited by an increasing solution effort with an increasing number of generated shifts, because demand fluctuations cannot be handled immediately. Thus the trade-off between a high number of suitable shifts and an acceptable solution effort has to be balanced by generating reduced sets of suitable shifts.

The aim is to complete transportation requests between pickup and delivery locations under user inconvenience considerations. In this work, we consider a real-world application of the patient transportation problem resulting in the dynamic variant of the DARP. Due to the fact that not all information about transportation requests is available in advance but is revealed during the planning process, it is essential to anticipate future events in the solution approach. Recent research has shown, that exploiting information about future events gained from historical data leads to better results that pure myopic solution approaches. One possibility is to apply anticipation heuristics, where newly arising requests are inserted into existing tours and vehicles have to wait at specific locations to meet possible future requests with minimum late arrivals. Anticipatory heuristics benefit from little computational effort, which is essential in highly dynamic systems, and still provide a good solution quality. Therefore, we implement different anticipation heuristics for the given real-world DARP, by taking advantage of information regarding various aspects such as the likelihood of a request, the spatial and temporal information of a request, and the type of a request.

In the first step “peak picking”, parameters are optimized by identifying 13C isotopic peaks and their respective 12C peaks. These isotopologue peaks are considered reliable peaks and lead to the calculation of a peak picking score which is maximized. In the second step, the parameters of “retention time correction” and “grouping” are optimized simultaneously. With respect to “grouping” the definition of ‘reliable groups’ and ‘non-reliable groups’ leads to a grouping score used as a target variable.

This variability is important since it greatly influences the trade-offs between the hospital costs and the patient-related performance measures such as waiting times or cancellations. As a result, a need for policies guiding the OR manager in handling the trade-offs arises. Therefore, researchers have investigated different possibilities to incorporate non-elective patients in the schedule with the goal of maximizing both patient- and hospital-related measures. The literature on OR planning, where both elective and non-elective patient categories are involved, proposes various policies. Due to the differences in the research settings however, contradicting results on measures such as overtime and patient waiting time are reported. Decisions on both operational policies as well as on capacity are required to assure timely access and efficiency.

At every time of the day, customer order goods (e. g., groceries) expecting fast and low-priced delivery. Therefore, companies route vehicles to deliver the ordered goods in the urban area. The dispatcher collects the orders in one (planning) period at the depot and serves them in another (execution) period, returning to the depot afterwards. If planning and execution period are at the same day, the company provides same day deliveries (SDD). If after all planned deliveries some free time of the working hours remains, vehicles may start a new (consecutive) tour with a subset of new orders appeared during the execution phase. Nevertheless, many of those dynamic orders might be included online in the current tour by dynamic routing allowing to fulfill an overall higher amount of SDD. For inclusion of new dynamic orders, vehicles have to revisit the depot on their route to pick up the ordered goods before serving the new customers. In this paper, we define a dynamic and stochastic SDD vehicle routing problem and present an dynamic delivery approach, dynamically including new orders in the current tour (DDA).

Indeed, load planning, fleet sizing and the other fleet management issues are much more complex in intermodal transportation systems than the single mode transportation systems. However, there is a lack of studies in literature which emphasize on fleet planning problems in multi-mode transportation systems. In detail, determination of the fleet size and composition constitutes the strategic fleet planning decisions whereas the tactical level decisions incorporate load planning, vehicle allocation/reallocation, empty vehicle repositioning issues etc. Since all of these decisions are interconnected with each other, they should be taken into account in an integrated way.  By this way, an appropriate fleet planning ensures not only cost reduction and profit maximization but also high level of customer satisfaction and low environmental effects. In this paper, a mixed-integer mathematical programming model is developed to solve multi-stage, multi-period fleet problems considering load planning and vehicle repositioning decisions.

We develop a demand model where the demands are influenced by an external factor, which is uncertain at planning time but on which a prior knowledge exists. Such knowledge is updated in a Bayesian fashion each time a customer is visited and its actual demand observed. The accumulated knowledge over the external factor is then used to better estimate the demands of the remaining customers in a route. We use such information in a dynamic programming algorithm, which prescribes preventive returns to the depot for replenishment before the route is resumed.\r\n\r\nWe combine the restocking policy from the dynamic programming algorithm with a heuristic for generating a priori routes.

To determine a particular customer’s tariff within the tariff structure offered, electricity retailers may use certain thresholds regarding the customer’s peak demand or energy consumption, i.e. a customer may be forced into a different tariff when its demand or consumption exceeds, or remains under, a relevant threshold. This can lead to a situation in which small changes in the energy demand or consumption of a customer may lead to a large difference in the electricity price that the customer has to pay.

Several clique relaxations have been defined either in terms of distance (s-clique), degree (s-plex, k-core), diameter (s-club), density (s-defective clique, γ-quasi-clique), or connectivity (k-block, s-bundle). The majority of the literature deals with identifying such subgraphs of maximum cardinality or weight.

The load planning problem for motorail trains, introduced as motorail transportation problem (MTP), aims at assigning a giving set of vehicles to trains. The MTP occurs during the booking process in case of order acceptance. Decision support for order acceptance management has already been developed and is currently running at DB Fernverkehr AG. Another application arises during the loading process at motorail terminals. Motorail terminals serve for the loading of vehicles onto motorail wagons. Terminals are directly connected to the rail system and are commonly located next to railway stations. Motorail trains arrive and depart according to a predetermined timetable. Vehicles are pre-booked and the train length, e.g. the number of transportation wagons, is known before departure. Due to differing and unknown arrival times of vehicles, pre-calculated loading plans can hardly be implemented in practice. Storage space is limited and thus vehicles need to be loaded as early as possible. Once loaded, vehicles are not allowed to change their position anymore. Thus, loading plans need to be consecutively revised in accordance with the current terminal situation and the already loaded vehicles. \r\n\r\nOptimization based decision support aims at speeding up the entire loading process while guaranteeing the feasibility of the proposed loading plan at all times.

The model includes main supply chain players such as suppliers, hotels, travel agents and tourist attractions. The model was developed to maximize the profit of the whole supply chain. In comparison, the model was also compared to the scenarios where individual profit is the objective. The actual data from the tourism supply chain in Thailand was used to validate the model.

This study concentrates on empirical prediction models that support business decisions through generating forecasts of future events.

First, we estimate the degree to which PMM diminishes the performance of predictive decision support models in the scope of an important business application: the selection of appropriate customers for direct marketing actions. Second, using the principles of ensemble selection, we propose a modeling framework that mitigates PMM. Our framework mimics the way in which managers make decisions and balances statistical and economic considerations during prediction model development. The results of a comprehensive empirical study confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In comparison to challenging benchmarks, it predicts customer behavior more accurately and recommends substantially more profitable target groups for marketing actions. The implications of our study are that i) PMM seriously harms purely statistical prediction models, that ii) an integration of statistical and economic considerations is a suitable remedy, and that iii) the integrated approach is also much more appropriate than a development of predictive decision support models that maximizes business objectives directly.

Based on a bottom-up aggregation of forecasts companies plan their overall supply.  The available supply is then disaggregated hierarchically (top down) and allocated to lower level organizational entities where it is consumed by customers. In current practice, this top down allocation is done by simple rules (rank based, fixed split or per commit) or based on aggregated measure of profitability. As Vogel (2014) points out, these allocation mechanisms often lead to suboptimal results in terms of overall profitability. \r\nOur research addresses a scenario in which customers are hierarchically structured, but differ in their service level agreements. We propose a single period model, where overall supply is scarce and has to be allocated to local warehouses. Each warehouse serves multiple customer groups with stochastic demand and differing service level requirements. Here, inventory rationing strategies can be employed to account for the heterogeneity in customer requirements. However, due to the overall shortage, at least some customers’ expected service level is lower than what was promised. Using multiple approaches (eg. penalties, goal programming) to balance deviations from the service level requirements of different customer groups, we derive conditions for optimal allocations to the warehouses under central planning and partitioned allocation. \r\nSubsequently, the insights obtained for central planner are used to derive procedures for a hierarchical, decentralized planning process to generate near optimal solutions.

There are some modelling options and in this paper we are interested in analyzing two of them: (i) by assuming a constant production factor in such way that the HPF is a function only of the turbined outflow; (ii) a piecewise linear approximation of the original HPF in this case the hydro production may depend on the storage, spillage and turbined outflow.

All maximum delays are equal to 1, implying that a task is allowed to start no later than one time period after its predecessor. The minimum delays are equal to zero, meaning that a task may be scheduled earliest in the same time period as its predecessor.

We call the first one economic neutral path and the latter engineering neutral path, very unlikely to match. The economic path might not be practically feasible and the engineering one may not necessarily guarantee the maximum profit. To have both profitable and feasible path we solve a dynamic optimization problem in which the objective function is the total profit of the field and the constraint is an engineering limit. This problem results in a dynamic optimal production path which is both feasible and profitable and is called in this paper Feasible and Profitable Neutral Path (FPNP).

The literature suggests that a partial vertical integration via equity participation may help the firms to ease contracting problems by aligning firms’ incentives, and thus improve the total surplus. We address the above proposition by studying a stylized model of a partially integrated supply chain in which the buyer holds an equity stake in the supplier. Assuming asymmetric information and a principal–agent form of relationship in this supply chain, we investigate optimal contracting between the parties within the classical joint economic lot size framework. We then study the effect of partial vertical integration on the contracting outcomes and demonstrate that the full vertical integration must not indeed be a pre-requisite for achieving supply chain coordination in the presence of asymmetric information; a minority stake may be capable of eliminating the transaction costs owing to information asymmetry and enable coordination. This does not however hold in general; in certain situations, achieving coordination is only possible with a majority ownership share.

In order to shed some light on their trade-off relationship, instead of using a weighted sum objective function, we introduce separate service-oriented objectives into the generalized consistent vehicle routing problem (GenConVRP) and into the home care routing and scheduling problem (HCRSP). In the multi-objective GenConVRP, in addition to routing costs, we optimize the maximum number of different drivers per customer (driver consistency) and the maximum arrival time difference on two different days in the planning horizon (arrival time consistency). In the bi-objective HCRSP, besides minimizing routing and overtime costs, we maximize the service level with respect to preferred visit times and nurses. Overtime costs in combination with interval preferences on preferred visit times results in a scheduling problem for each route that is a bi-objective problem in itself, which is a distinctive characteristic of the bi-objective HCRSP. For both problems we solve small instances to optimality using the epsilon-constraint scheme. To solve larger instances we devise algorithms combining large neighborhood search and multi-directional local search. We can show that a considerable trade-off between cost and client-oriented objectives exists. However, our results also reveal that, using the minimum cost solution as a basis, the considered visit time-oriented service levels may be improved drastically with only small additional costs.

We show that relative performance evaluation provides incentives to choose a suboptimal low level of differentiation as differentiation diminishes the risk filtering effect of a relative performance component. Consequently, the sensitivity of the optimal performance scheme to the competitor’s success decreases, i.e. less relative performance evaluation is used in presence of a differentiation decision. Our model predicts that managers want to decrease the differentiation level and thereby increase the correlation between the performances of their firm and its benchmarks when relative performance evaluation is used. We test this hypothesis with data from firms in Germany and the UK that introduced a relative performance component between 2006 and 2013. Our event study gives evidence that the adoption of relative performance evaluation components will lead to stronger correlated returns of the adopting firm and its peers.

We assume that system evolution is described by a Markov process, where system topology is encoded as a directed graph with nodes representing system components and links representing the contagion flow.  We define the individual node risk as the probability of this node being in an “undesirable” state, and systemic risk as the individual risk averaged over all the nodes in the system.  Since dimension of the Markov description is prohibitively high, we propose a mean-field approximation for individual risks of much lower dimension.  Negative externalities with respect to risk exposure due to risk sharing allow us to employ Perron-Frobenius theory to analyze the mean-field system of non-linear, fixed-point equations.  We argue that economics drives networked systems towards the boundary of the “normal/operational” region with respect to the system parameters, where the mean-field equations have a “low systemic risk” solution.  We suggest that systemic risk of abrupt/discontinuous instabilities should be of higher concern for networked system designers and operators than systemic risk of gradual/continuous instabilities, and propose a Perron-Frobenius based systemic risk management framework, which addresses this concern and quantifies the corresponding risk/benefit tradeoff.\r\n", :title "Towards Managing Systemic Risk in Networked Systems", :keyword2 93, :authors (49265), :session 328}, 997 {:keyword1 101, :keyword3 40, :abstract "Current tactical optimization models are usually focused on an overall objective, regardless of the different individual partner objectives to be considered in a decentralized Supply Chain (SC).

Instead of determining arrival times to the minute in this phase yet, we assign several aircraft to the same time window of a given size. The exact orders within those time windows can be decided later in tactical planning. Mathematically, this leads to a b-matching problem on a bipartite graph with side constraints.

It is a classical result that earliest arrival flows always exist in the single source case while the existence of earliest arrival flows in networks with multiple sources has been shown more recently in the early 2000s. In the single source case earliest arrival flows can be computed in PSpace using the successive shortest path algorithm. In networks with multiple sources it gets more complicated. In 2006 Nadine Baumann and Martin Skutella developed an algorithm to compute earliest arrival flows in networks with multiple sources which is polynomial in the input plus output size. Their algorithm  consists of two parts: At first the earliest arrival pattern is computed and after that using the breakpoints of the pattern the actual earliest arrival flow is derived. While the first part of the algorithm only works on the original network, the second part requires expanding the network such that in the wost case it gets exponentially large.

The lack of a comprehensive partnership evaluation approach has been identified as one of the main reasons for partnership failure. This study presents a decision support model to evaluate a B2B partnership in different periods based on the performance measures associated with the drivers of each partner for entering into the partnership. Different Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods are used in the model in order to address the interdependency, the importance of, and the uncertainty in performance measures. MCDM methods address human memory and cognitive limits and biases that lead to defects in an environment of increasing complexity and information overload such as those in B2B partnerships. The proposed model has two outputs: 1) the overall importance of each performance measure, 2) a single multidimensional index for the overall partnership performance in each period, named as Partnership Performance Index (PPI). PPI is different from either mere financial or operational performance measures. It includes multiple measures associated with the partnership drivers as well as their importance and interdependencies.

A common practice for the formulation of these problems consists in describing an ore reserve via the construction of a three-dimensional block model of the three-dimensional mining site. Typically a mine can be constituted by several thousands or millions of blocks. Each block corresponds to a unitary volume of extraction characterized by geologic and economic properties which are estimated from sample data. Block models can be represented as directed graphs where nodes are associated with blocks, while arcs correspond to the precedence of these blocks in the ore reserve. The precedence order is induced by physical and operational constraints as those derived from the geo-mechanics of slope stability. This approach gives rise to huge combinatorial problems whose mathematical formulations are special large-scale instances of Integer Programming Optimization problems. Operational mine plans are usually produced on a yearly basis and further scheduling is attempted to provide monthly, weekly and daily schedules. A portion of the ore reserve is said to be exposed if it is readily available for extraction at the start of the next period. In this work, we propose an integer programming model to generate pit designs under exposed ore reserve requirements.

The task of a LTL terminal is the accurate and in time handling of shipments between vehicles on short-distance traffic and transport vehicles on long-distance traffic. The performance of a LTL terminal is largely determined by the proper use of the gates. A gate assignment plan should minimize the waiting times of the trucks while having short transportation distances for the goods inside the terminal. However, many uncertain factors influence the planning. Especially fluctuations in the arrival times of vehicles have great impact on the planning process. Thus it is reasonable to use stochastic optimization to create a gate assignment plan which can handle the occurring uncertainties.\r\nThe developed optimization model is based on the two-stage stochastic optimization using scenario decomposition. A finite number of realizations of the random data, called scenarios, are considered to model the uncertainties. In our two-stage model for the gate assignment problem, the assignments of the trucks to the gates are used as the first stage decision variables. All remaining variables, e.g. the assignment times of the trucks, are the second stage decision variables. Which means, in the first stage, a gate assignment is determined.

This location-allocation problem of locating such data to multiple servers is a cost-optimization problem. Many other decisions such as server location, query routing, user assignment are addressed simultaneously. The modelling approach builds on the uncapacitated single allocation p-hub median problem. The servers that host subsets of content (database segments) are treated as data hubs. The data hubs are connected to each other by high-bandwidth links (backbone). The primary attraction of a hub location model is that the cost of routing large volumes of queries through these links is discounted due to the economies of scale.\r\n\r\nWe consider a variant in which the backbone is restricted to be a tree. Our model is inspired by the \"tree of hubs\" problem from physical logistics. This variant is extremely difficult to solve because the construction of the tree, given other decisions a-priori, is itself an NP -hard problem, known as the optimum communication spanning tree problem (OCSTP). However, prior information on the segment allocation, server location, and the tree backbone, reduces the original problem to a simple assignment problem, and therefore, indicates the suitability of a decomposition approach. We reformulate the problem to a 4-subscripted MILP yielding tight LP bounds and develop a Benders decomposition approach.

It is proposed to apply the general systemic procedure for supporting the ill-structured negotiation problems. The procedure consists of two stages.

The advantages of the new framework are illustrated with an extensive empirical study. It leads to superior multivariate density and Value-at-Risk forecasting, and better portfolio performance. The proposed risk fear portfolio strategy outperforms various competing types of optimal portfolios, even in the presence of conservative transaction costs and frequent rebalancing. The risk monitoring of the optimal portfolio can serve as an early warning system against large market risks.

This is essential to transfer the information furnished by these new technologies into practical applications such as combined cancer therapy and microbial bioleaching. \r\n\r\nUsing tools like Bayesian analysis and clustering methods in a data-driven approach, we reverse-engineer experimental datasets into biological interaction networks. We further investigate the results using an in-house developed computational platform for sensitivity analysis of biological networks. Our simulations are based on principles of physical biochemistry and enzyme kinetics to represent activation/inhibition networks under simplifying assumptions that allow to deal with real-life scenarios. \r\n\r\nBoth in cancer biology and microbial ecology, biological networks are abstracted from an experimental system and modelling is subsequently used to optimize complex processes by controlling key nodes of the network. This allows us to make cancer therapies more specific to drug resistance, or to make the process of copper extraction from mining waste more efficient and ecologically friendly. \r\n\r\nThis paper is coauthored by Ran Friedman, Mark Dopson(4) and Igor Pivkin.", :title "Modelling and Analysis of High-throughput Data in Cancer Research and in Microbial Ecology", :keyword2 0, :authors (48698), :session 91}, 1152 {:keyword1 96, :keyword3 0, :abstract "As the maritime industry grows rapidly in size, more attention is being paid to to a wide range of aspects of problems faced at ports with respect to the efficient allocation of resources. A very important seaside planning problem that has received large attention in literature lately is the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP). The problem involves the creation of a work schedule for the available quay cranes at the port to empty the containers from a vessel or given set of vessels. These optimization problems can be very complex and since they involve a large number of variables and constraints, the use of a commercial solver is impractical. In this paper, we reformulate a problem currently available in the literature to a Dantzig-Wolfe formulation that can be solved by column generation. We then develop a branch-and-price algorithm, which is an exact method, to effectively solve mixed integer programs with very large instances. The algorithm is first tested on a formulation currently available in literature with a small instance and will then be tested on large instances.", :title "The quay crane scheduling problem: an exact solution approach", :keyword2 0, :authors (35101), :session 168}, 1154 {:keyword1 165, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The bilevel programming problem (BLPP) acts as an optimization problem whose constraint region is determined implicitly by another mathematical programming problem. An ordered hierarchy structure between two decision makers appears, when they have conflicting objectives. The decision\r\nmaker at the upper level (leader) evaluates his objective function after the possible reaction of the decision maker at the lower level (the follower) is clear.\r\nHereupon, the follower selects his decision under the given decision of the\r\nleader. Many real-life problems can be translated into a bilevel programming problem, for instance problems of transportation, management and economics, engineering design, supply chain planning, and health insurance. This paper is dedicated to the study of a certain linear bilevel programming problem eqipped with a two stage stochastic lower level. We transfer the given problem to a single-level optimization problem whose constraints comprise affine complementarity conditions and a variational inequality in order to derive necessary optimality conditions. The global and local relationship of the original bilevel programming problem and the surrogate problem are studied. Results from variational analysis are used to derive stationarity conditions for the mentioned single-level problem and, hence, for the given bilevel programming problem.\r\n", :title "A bilevel programming problem with stochastic lower level", :keyword2 0, :authors (49628 7687 49633), :session 283}}, :users {1 {:firstname "Bernard", :lastname "Fortz", :department "Département d'Informatique", :institution "Université Libre de Bruxelles", :country "Belgium", :sessions (55 49)}, 125 {:firstname "Norbert", :lastname "Trautmann", :department "Department of Business Administration", :institution "University of Bern", :country "Switzerland", :sessions (268 293 409)}, 128 {:firstname "Rainer", :lastname "Burkard", :department "Institute of Optimization and Discrete Mathematics", :institution "Graz University of Technology", :country "Austria", :sessions (186)}, 139 {:firstname "Laureano Fernando", :lastname "Escudero", :department "Estadística e  Investigación Operativa", :institution "Universidad Rey Juan Carlos", :country "Spain", :sessions (283)}, 149 {:firstname "Bettina", :lastname "Klinz", :department "Institut für Optimierung und Diskrete Mathematik", :institution "TU Graz", :country "Austria", :sessions (107 373)}, 227 {:firstname "Irinel", :lastname "Dragan", :department "Mathematics", :institution "University of Texas", :country "United States", :sessions (351)}, 240 {:firstname "Jesper", :lastname "Larsen", :department "Department of Management Engineering", :institution "Technical University of Denmark", :country "Denmark", :sessions (309)}, 247 {:firstname "Rainer", :lastname "Leisten", :department "Operations Management", :institution "University Duisburg-Essen in Duisburg", :country "Germany", :sessions (303 366 270 310)}, 281 {:firstname "Ulrike", :lastname "Leopold-Wildburger", :department "Statistics and Operations Research", :institution "Karl-Franzens-University", :country "Austria", :sessions (278)}, 333 {:firstname "Gerhard", :lastname "Wäscher", :department "Fakultät für Wirtschaftswissenschaft", :institution "Otto-von-Guericke Universität Magdeburg", :country "Germany", :sessions (405)}, 347 {:firstname "Frank", :lastname "Werner", :department "Faculty of Mathematics", :institution "Otto-von-Guericke University, FMA,I", :country "Germany", :sessions (77)}, 454 {:firstname "Rudolf", :lastname "Vetschera", :department "Dept. of Business Administration", :institution "University of Vienna", :country "Austria", :sessions (384)}, 518 {:firstname "Luca Maria", :lastname "Gambardella", :department "Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza Artificiale", :institution "IDSIA", :country "Switzerland", :sessions (361)}, 607 {:firstname "Gerhard", :lastname "Reinelt", :department "Institut for Computer Science", :institution "University of Heidelberg", :country "Germany", :sessions (200 113)}, 626 {:firstname "Denis", :lastname "Towill", :department "", :institution "Cardiff Business School", :country "United Kingdom", :sessions (134)}, 634 {:firstname "Z.
