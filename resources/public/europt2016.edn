It is also assumed that evaluation of the objective function at a point is a time-consuming operation. \r\n\r\nSeveral adaptive partition methods and strategies for estimating the Lipschitz constant are analyzed.

A number of unconventional ideas, such as adaptive strategies for estimating Lipschitz constant, balancing global and local information to accelerate the search, etc. are presented.

In the seemingly simple case of a convex objective function there exists everywhere a nonempty set of subgradients whose shortest element provides a direction of descent. While this set is also convex it may be quite difficult to compute and epresent. On the other hand there are classical scenarios where it is quite easy to compute one of the subgradients, or in the more general Lipschitzian case, one generalized gradient. This lead to the widely accepted black-box paradigm, namely that nonsmooth optimization algorithms should be based on an evaluation oracle that provides the function value and just one\r\ngeneralized gradient at any point in the function domain. The resulting bundle methods were described and analyzed in great detail, for example in the classical books of Jean Baptiste Hirriart Urruty and Claude Lemarechal [3]. \r\n    There exist very simple examples, where due to the codependence of intermediate quantities, such a generalized gradient cannot be computed\r\nby the application of generalized differentiation rules.  Moreover, even when generalized gradients are available everywhere, the resulting descent algorithms are typically quite slow and suffer from the lack of practical stopping criteria. Ideally, these should be based on computable and reasonably sharp optimality conditions, that are satisfied approximately in a small but open neighborhood of a local minimizer. It will be shown here that this desirable situation can be achieved for objectives in the so called abs-normal form, which also yields enough information to achieve, linear, superlinear, or even quadratic convergence, by successive piecewise linearization provided certain nondegeneracy conditions are satisfied. \r\n    Any piecewise smooth function that is specified by an evaluation procedure involving smooth elemental functions and piecewise linear functions like min and max can be represented in abs-normal form [1]. This is in particular true for most popular nonsmooth test functions. By an extension of algorithmic, or automatic differentiation, one can then compute certain first and second order derivative vectors and matrices that represent a local piecewise linearization and provide additional curvature information. On the basis of these quantities we characterize local optimality by first and second order necessary and sufficient conditions [2], which generalize the corresponding KKT and SSC theory for\r\nsmooth problems. The key assumption is the Linear Independence Kink Qualification (LIKQ), a generalization of LICQ familiar from NLOP. It implies that the objective has locally a so-called VU decomposition [4] and renders everything tractable in terms of matrix factorizations and other simple linear algebra operations. \r\n    In the smooth case local optimality conditions usually combine a stationarity condition with a convexity conditions. In contrast, nonsmooth objectives can have strongly isolated minima without having even weakly supporting hyperplanes at arbitrarily close neighboring point. Since in some applications such as multiphase equilibria, local convexity itself is necessary for single phase stability, one may also ask for convexity conditions for piecewise smooth functions in absnormal form. As it turns out this property seems to be much more difficult to verify than optimality as even the question of first order convexity, i.e. convexity of the local piecewise linear model appears to be NP hard.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Abs-normal form, Piecewise linearization, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker, Second order optimality, Tangential stationarity, Normal growth, VU decomposition, First order convexity.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] A.

A significant part of the talk will be concentrated on high-dimensional global optimization problems and the so-called \"curse of dimensionality\". We will discuss the geometry of high-dimensional balls and cubes, very slow convergence of global random search algorithms in large-dimensional problems and poor uniformity of the so-called uniformly distributed sequences of points.

One of the most important local stability notions is the Aubin (Lipschitz-like) property which ensures that the perturbed problems\r\n(i) do possess a solution, and\r\n(ii) the distance of this solution from the original (reference) solution is bounded above by a multiple of the norm of the perturbation.\r\nIn the lecture, a new non-restrictive suffcient condition for the Aubin property will be presented in the general framework of implicitly defined multifunctions. In this development our main tool are generalized derivatives and coderivatives which provide a convenient description of the local behavior of nonsmooth and set-valued mappings. In particular, it is the directional limiting coderivative due to H. Gfrerer, which is tailored to fine local analysis of multifunctions along specified directions. \r\nThis new condition will then be specialized to constraint and variational systems having a frequently arising structure, which requires a development of a certain calculus for the directional limiting coderivatives. We will present one rule of this new calculus generalizing a formula due to Dontchev and Rockafellar. The advantages of this new approach will be illustrated by examples.
