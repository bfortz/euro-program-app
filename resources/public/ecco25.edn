The presentation will describe a case study of such an interaction in which a function is learnt in a feature space defined by an adapting combination of kernels. This situation is known as multiple kernel learning in machine learning and is closely related to the group Lasso models studied in statistics. The analysis of this interaction is furthered by casting the problem as a global optimisation. This ensures that the two learning components do not induce instabilities in each others' convergence and that their interaction can be effected through a simple protocol. The global optimisation while ensuring stable convergence does not guarantee the statistical properties of the estimated function. We will present results that bound the statistical reliability of the resulting classifiers indicating that the extra flexibility implied by the adapting representation comes at a modest cost.\r\nExtension of the ideas to regression (group Lasso) will also be presented as will combinations between more complex learning tasks such as Bandit algorithms and more complex classes of representations such as those arising from Hidden Markov Model derived kernels.\r\n\r\n", :title "Adapting Representations for Specific Tasks", :keyword2 13, :authors (10994), :session 3}, 75 {:keyword1 19, :keyword3 0, :abstract "In simple plant location problems (SPLP), the time dimension is not explicitly considered, either because there are not significant costs for relocating facilities, or because the assignment costs are not expected to change significantly as time goes by.
