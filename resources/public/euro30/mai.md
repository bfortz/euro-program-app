## Monday 24th June:

MA: **Speed networking and EURO working group on practice of OR** (Chair:Ruth Kaufman)

One of the most important reasons for coming to a conference is to build your circle of professional acquaintance - with like-minded people who can encourage and inspire you, and with not-quite-so-likeminded people who can challenge and extend you, and with the many people who you can encourage, inspire, and challenge. However, it is not always easy to meet people when most of our time is spent sitting listening to presentations, especially for the shy people amongst us. The speed networking session is a supportive, managed way of meeting people you don't know: a series of short, quick-fire sharing of professional information with other participants, together with an exchange of contact details if you meet somebody you want to keep in touch with.  Latecomers will be admitted but may have to wait for a few minutes before they can join in. Bring business cards, or be ready to scan QR codes with your linkedin app, to keep in touch.

The meeting will also include a short presentation about the EURO Working Group on Practice of OR, aimed at supporting a pan-European network of practitioners.

I really liked the setup"... "Great start to the conference" (comments from 2018
participants)

MB: **Fast and Furious: lightning talks** (Chair: Ruth Kaufman) 

At a EURO conference there is an enormous amount
of interesting material that any one person can only see a small
fraction of. This session will help boost that fraction, with a wide
variety of fast-moving and stimulating talks. Into this 90-minute
session, we will squeeze no fewer than 12 -- maybe more! -- 'lightning
talks' from speakers at every level of eminence and experience. Some
will be giving a compressed version of their talk later in the
conference, whilst others will be talking on something completely
different.

For full list with abstracts and author details, see below. 

"A really good format ... especially liked the 5 minute talks because
they focused on the key messages instead of going into too much" (2018

MC: **Operations Research Meets Machine Learning: highlights from the
2nd conference of the EWG-POR** (Matteo Pozzi)

More than 100 OR practitioners and industrial representatives met in
Bologna on 11-12th March 2019 for the 2nd conference of the EURO Working
Group on Practice of Operations Research to exchange experiences and
best practices, with a particular focus on the relationship between
Operations Research and Machine Learning (and Data Science at large).
What came out was the picture of a rapidly evolving business community,
rooted in its core skills, but also open to new challenges with a focus
to developing increasingly effective Decision Support Systems. This
session will report on the event and its key findings, representing an
additional chance to foster debate and confrontation about this very
actual
issue.

MD: **From Data to Decisions. The challenges of the digitalization era**
(Raffaele Maccioni)

It is not always so easy to take the best decisions, both strategic, like to redesign the
supply chain, or operative like to deliver goods at min costs, or to
define prices and promotions. Even more, sometimes it is not so clear
what "best" really means. This is also true for the solution that has
been awarded by Informs as a finalist of the Franz Edelman Award. ACT
Operations Research provides an inspiring view on what it takes to
develop and implement "deep-analytical"
solutions.

## Tuesday 25th June: focus on practice and industry

TA: **OR impact across industries** (Jean André)

a. Airport Ground Staff Scheduling: A Real-World Business Application

Staff scheduling and rostering involves a number of
hierarchical subproblems including demand modeling, task generation,
shift design, days-off scheduling, shift assignment and real-time
dispatching. When solving highly constrained large-scale workforce
planning problems it is usually not computationally practical to deal
simultaneously with all these tasks. Real-world software solutions
typically decompose the overall planning task into heuristically
designed subproblems which then are tackled by a variety of suitable
exact and heuristic methods. We present results from a major research
and business project with Swissport International, the largest ground
handling company worldwide, which provides services for 850 customers
and 265 million passengers a year, with a workforce of 68 000 personnel
at 315 airports. During a long-term strategic cooperation, a
high-performance software for automated staff scheduling has been
developed, which is able to solve the complex large-scale rostering
problems in Swissport's airport operations. The methodology comprises a
broad range of optimization techniques including preprocessing,
decomposition and relaxation approaches, mixed-integer programming
models, and various heuristic procedures. Operational deployment started
at Zurich Airport and is continually being extended to other airports
and customers. Bottom line benefits include faster and more robust
planning processes, improved roster quality, and substantial financial
savings.

b. Examples of mathematical decision support models for operations management and planning

We present examples on how development of mathematical decision support
models and their implementations have improved operations management and
planning in the Finnish state-owned railway operator VR. Our examples'
application domains include personnel planning, locomotive allocation,
and maintenance scheduling. The developed solutions utilize, for
example, mixed integer linear optimization, constraint programming,
combinations of heuristic solution algorithms, and Monte Carlo
simulation.

TB: **OR impact on societal problems** (Chair:Michele Quattrone)

a. Extending Capture-Recapture to Estimate Border Security

To maintain secure borders it is vital to measure the effectiveness of
border security measures. Capture-recapture techniques have been
proposed, augmented by biometric identification to play the role of
"tagging." These models cannot deal with the confounding between
deterrence and detection. We introduce a "two fluid model" which
binarizes the effect of having been caught once. This permits estimation
of the effectiveness of border security, by focusing on those identified
persons who persist in border crossing, as probes of effectiveness. We
explore the problems of (1) resolving the deterrence-detection
confounding using non-linear optimization and (2) incorporating
pseudo-Darwinian models, in which those persons who are repeatedly
captured are modeled as belonging to the "low end" of a spectrum of
"ability to avoid capture." We assess the theoretical analysis using
simulation methods, and explore the path to application in realistic
situations, where there are multiple paths by which to cross one or more
borders. Research supported in part by the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security Center of Excellence for Borders, Trade and
Immigration.

b. Justice in Time: Applying Operations Theory to Court Systems -- The Case of the Jerusalem District Court

If there is some truth to the old principle that justice must not
only be done, but must be seen to be done, then surely it must be seen
to be done in a timely manner. Nevertheless, court congestion and
delays---which threaten to undermine the justice system---became a
global phenomenon with significant adverse implications on social
welfare, economic development and civil rights. In this research, we
report on the application of several operations management tools to
tackle this problem and help reduce congestion in courts. In cooperation
with the Jerusalem District Court in Israel, we have implemented the
following changes in the judicial process: (1) Introduction of a new
planning and scheduling phase; (2) Modification of the hearing
scheduling policy from hearing-based FIFO policy to case-based FIFO
policy; (3) Shortening the summations stage by encouraging oral
summations. We evaluate the effect of these operational changes by
performing a before-after econometric analysis. Our results demonstrate
a 40% reduction in trial time (the treated part of the process), which
translates into 18.87% reduction in the total life cycle of a
case.

c. Letting a hundred data scientists bloom: harnessing the
power of cutting-edge data science to improve the outcomes of critically
ill children

BACKGROUND: Advanced data
science has been hailed as a game changer in delivering better health
care. The UK NHS has many large datasets but these are messy, hard to
interpret and the use of advanced data science techniques is still in
its infancy. Operational Researchers could be key in meeting the
challenge of how to mesh the highly technical world of data science with
the realities of front-line clinical decision making. The UK Turing
Institute for data science runs regular Data Study Groups (DSGs) where a
hundred top data scientists from all fields gather for a week of intense
work on real-world problems. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) has a
unique high resolution vital sign dataset of 5500 children in intensive
care and contributed a problem to the DSG for April 2019.

THE PROBLEM GIVEN TO THE DSG: When children are on life-support, their vital
signs are monitored continuously. Clinical staff make treatment
decisions informed by current snapshots of these signs. The challenge
was to develop predictive algorithms that out-perform clinical
decision-making for one high-risk decision faced for every patient:
optimal timing for a trial of breathing without life-support.

THIS TALK: I am an Operational Researcher and will discuss how I worked
closely with GOSH and others to conceive of, negotiate, plan, execute
and interpret the hospital's foray into new data science. I will discuss
the skills needed, the challenges encountered and the preliminary
results.

d. Blockchain in food distribution: do you know where your
food has been?

This paper aims to explain the implementation of blockchain technology in the
production and supply chain delivery system for beef/cattle by a company based
in the USA (Bytable Foods). One of the primary research questions is how
blockchain can more accurately and transparently move goods through supply
chains. This company, and paper, are at the leading edge of developing such
systems in industry. Bytable Foods has various initiatives in development on
the front line of blockchain. Bytable Foods is making food traceable and
transparent through trustworthy data chains that track products from farm to
fork using blockchain technology and internet of things. By creating traceable
and transparent supply chains for food, consumers are given the information
they need to make the right choice about the food they buy and the companies
they support.  For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability
and transparency builds better relationships with their customers, increases
efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product
loss. The technology and business are creating a case for fixing and
transforming the world's food system.<br> One case study of interest in the
academic and industry community is related to the cattle industry. Bytable was
founded in Iowa and is based in Colorado while IBM is working on a similar
application called
Beefchain.

TC: **Round table 1:  Making an impact across industry** (Chair:Jean André)

Around this roundtable, the panel will talk about the key performance
indicators (economical, environmental...) industrial companies are trying to
optimize jointly or separately (included or not in the models), the impact
through examples on the operations to transform the way they work, the
integration within their working environment and processes (user interactivity,
HMI and others), the qualitative benefits such as team training, knowledge
sharing... They will also cover the challenges of understanding the business
needs and transform it iteratively into optimization models, the modeling
effort to capture all the dynamic situations faced by operations, the
difficulties of user acceptance vs the other tools they have used in the past
(comparative effect) or home made tools or well marketed magic tools, how they
are guaranteeing the actual
use...

TD: **Round table 2: Successful factors of industry/academics partnerships** (Chair: Michele Quattrone)

Around this roundtable, the panel will discuss about the key ingredients that make an
industry/academic partnership successful from an industrial and academic points
of view. How do we initiate such partnerships? How do we track the evolution?
Do we need to precisely define the roles in such partnerships ? What is
expected from industrials by academics: data, real life topics, business
expertises...? What is expected from academics by industrials: scientific
excellence, modeling practice, algorithmic developments, hype technological
check...? What are the final output of such collaboration expected: prototyped
models, feasibility studies, Proof of concepts...? What are the issues that are regularly faced in such collaborations: misunderstandings, Intellectual Property,...?

## Wednesday 26th June: panel, tutorials and workshops

WA: **How can better governance save the world with the help of
OR?** a joint effort of the streams on
Governance Analytics and Making an Impact, on the Practice of OR (Chair:
Joaquim
Gromicho)

The United Nations just published [an alarming report](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/)
showing that mankind not only leads to an
accelerated rate of extinction of species but is orchestrating its own
extinction, unless a dramatic change occurs. This calls for effective
global governance measures. Intentions are however not enough: for
instance agreeing on an amount of emission reduction is not the same as
knowing how to reach such objective. Resources are also unequally
distributed: we produce more than enough food to feed mankind,
nevertheless more than 10% of the world is starving. Careful planning
may lead to bringing food to those that need it at low cost and on time.
Means of mass transportation have a lower environmental impact but are
difficult to plan to the full extent of their potential. Huge
opportunities for OR to develop the instruments that effective
governance may use to improve the condition of our planet. The panel
brings together experts in governance, sustainability, energy, societal
impact, mass transportation, defense against the forces of nature and on
how to effectively feed the world. The panel includes recipient of past
Frans Edelman awards for impact on profit, people and planet. The panel
discussion is started by Cathal MacSwiney Brugha.   The panel members
are:

- Cathal MacSwiney Brugha, Emeritus Professor of Decision Analytics,
University College Dublin, President, Analytics Society of
Ireland.
- Ulrike Reisach, [plenary speaker at EURO](https://www.euro2019dublin.com/plenary-speakers) and active in international strategy development and societal,
institutional, cultural and ethical
issues.
- Iris van Beuzekom, sustainability officer of ORTEC, company that was
part of the team recipient of [the Franz Edelman award in 2012](https://www-informs-org.vu-nl.idm.oclc.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/TNT-Express) and researching transition of multiple related energy
networks.
- Dick den Hertog, [plenary speaker at EURO](https://www.euro2019dublin.com/plenary-speakers), [recipient of Franz Edelman award in 2013](https://www-informs-org.vu-nl.idm.oclc.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Dutch-Delta-Program-Commissioner), and involved in optimizing toward the [zero-hunger objective of the World Food Program](https://www1.wfp.org/zero-hunger).    
- Dennis Huisman, [recipient of Franz Edelman award in 2008](https://www-informs-org.vu-nl.idm.oclc.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Netherlands-Railways2) and an expert on optimizing mass transportation networks.

WB: **Tutorial: Optimizing with Python** (Leader:Joaquim Gromicho)

Academics in OR learned a multitude of programming and modeling languages, all with their strong and weak points. Nowadays general purpose languages exist and python seems to dominate on all domains of analytics, but how good is it for
optimization? That is exactly what this tutorial will teach you, taking
into account mathematical modelling and optimization and also the
development of heuristics for hard and challenging
problems.

WC: **Tutorial: let the data do the talking** (Leader: Jasper Lodder)

As Tom Davenport (known for proclaiming Data Science to be the most sexy job on the
planet in 2012) [says](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/topics/analytics/data-driven-storytelling.html) "Most people can't understand the details of analytics, but they do want
evidence of analysis and data. Stories that incorporate data and
analytics are more convincing than those based on anecdotes or personal
experience. Perhaps the most compelling stories of all are those that
combine data and analytics, and a point of view or example that involves
real people and organizations." Jasper Lodder will take us through the
available technologies and methodologies for effective analytics
storytelling, all the way from the first contact with messy data to
taking decisions based on optimization
models.

WD: **Workshop: how hands on helps OR with benchmarks and challenges** (Chair: Alex Fleischer)

We love a good puzzle, what about you? And are you in for a challenge? We
believe that puzzles and challenges are great instruments to develop
your OR skills. We will share our experiences and convince you that
having fun makes you a better OR professional! Kaggle is famous among
the data scientists and prediction analytics professionals and has no
comparable optimization counterpart, but there are many options to
challenge and improve your optimization skills. We report on great
puzzles, benchmarks and challenges and on our experience on using
challenges as an instrument to teach
OR.

## Fast and Furious lightning talks

- Elise de Rosario: **OR at your service**

    Are you providing OR services to an internal or an external client? As
    a manager or member of a  group of internal consultants, you deal  with
    such issues as establishing your credibility, sourcing and justifying
    your staff complement,  why the group has to be centralized or
    decentralized; prioritizing projects and whether or not to charge for
    services. As an external consultant however, your concern becomes more
    of defining and managing project expectations on scope and deliverables
    as you prepare your proposal.  In both cases however, it is important to
    have skills in communicating your findings and ensuring  that there is a
    project champion who sincerely wants an objective basis for
    decision-making, rather than one who just wants you to prove them right.
    This talk draws on many years of experience in both roles, to discuss
    these issues.

    Elise del Rosario was VP of OR in  San Miguel Corporation, She founded
    ORSP (Operations Research Society of the Philippines), headed the ORSP
    Committee on OR for Public Service (ORSP Corps) and was President of
    IFORS.

- Michael O'Neill: **Business Analytics Capability, Organisational Value and Competitive Advantage**

    Business Analytics makes the assumption that given a sufficient set of
    analytics capabilities exist within an organisation, the existence of
    these capabilities will result in the generation of organisational value
    and competitive advantage. Taken further, do enhanced capability levels
    lead to enhanced impact for organisations? Capability in this study is
    grounded in the four pillars of Governance, Culture, Technology and
    People from the Cosic, Shanks and Maynard capability framework. We set
    out to undertake the first empirical investigation to measure if there
    is a positive relationship between Business Analytics capability levels
    as defined by Cosic, Shanks and Maynard, and the generation of value and
    competitive advantage for organisations. Do enhanced capability levels
    lead to enhanced impact? A survey of 64 senior analytics professionals
    from 17 sectors showed a strong and statistically significant
    correlation between higher capability levels and the ability to generate
    enhanced organisational value and competitive
    advantage.

    Michael O'Neill is Full Professor of Business Analytics in the UCD
    School of Business, and a founding Director of the UCD Natural Computing
    Research & Applications Group.

- Irene Pluchinotta: **Being a decision analyst in collaborative decision-making processes: lessons learnt**

    Collaborative decision-making is an intricate task for decision makers
    and decision analysts. Governments, public bodies and private-sector are
    beginning to involve stakeholders to a far greater extent than before.
    Actors with different values, points of view, rationales, and
    conflicting objectives are brought together in a collective process.
    Stakeholders involvement increases the need for effective
    decision-making processes and for structured stakeholder engagement
    activities.  How to handle a more inclusive decision-making process in
    multi-stakeholder settings? How to foster collaborative innovation in
    the case of decision makers operating in multi-organizational
    arrangements that tackle complex decision problems? The talk will share
    lessons learnt from series of facilitated workshops integrating OR
    methodologies and Design Theory. It will present an approach to formally
    support innovation in more collaborative, interactive and horizontal
    decision-making processes through the lens of real-life case
    studies.

    Irene is a researcher at King's College London with a double PhD in
    environmental engineering and computer science. She uses OR
    methodologies to support collaborative decision-making processes in
    complex multi-stakeholder
    settings.

- John Poppelaars: **Modelling at the speed of light?**

    One of my visions as an OR practitioner is to start a meeting with a
    client, have some data and a vague description of a decision problem,
    and within hours, end the meeting with a fully-functioning prototype of
    a decision support system.  Impossible?  Perhaps. It is true that quite
    a bit of time is required to complete the path from data to a solution. 
    As a result, many decision makers shy away from OR as they need a
    solution fast.  The current reality is that we quickly get side-tracked
    by IT challenges such as coding, debugging, ETL nightmares and dealing
    with GUI development.  In this talk, I would like to show you that
    change is on its way!  Of course, not at the speed of light, but fast
    enough to make my vision become a new reality.

    John Poppelaars is practice leader Advanced Analytics at BearingPoint
    and author of the OR at Work blog.

- Paul Harper: **OR Saves Lives!**
  
    Healthcare systems are stochastic in nature; that is they typically operate
    in an environment of uncertainty and variability, both at scale and within
    highly complex and connected networks.  Furthermore, many healthcare
    services are under significant pressure to deliver more with less.  OR
    methods can help healthcare providers move towards optimally configured
    services.  This is much safer than experimenting with changes to the system
    for real and seeing what happens.  Literally it can help save lives, for
    example in one major hospital our research completely redesigned the care
    for stroke patients, which resulted in a reduction in mortality rates by
    60%.  In another hospital emergency department, our work helped to save the
    Health Board  £1.6m per year through optimised capacity planning.  In this
    talk I will provide an overview of some current and recent OR healthcare
    modelling projects at Cardiff, highlighting different OR methodologies and
    demonstrating impact.

- Mary Conlon: **From CT scanning to process modelling  - a radiographer's experience of modelling busyness**

    Demand for diagnostic imaging services is increasing year on year,
    driven by Ireland's growing, ailing and ageing population. Radiology
    workload, when defined in crude numbers of examinations completed, fails
    to capture staff workload and patient
    complexity. 

    As a clinical radiographer undertaking a PhD in healthcare modelling I
    have been in a perfect position to examine the use of operational
    research techniques, as communication and modelling tools. I have
    analysed radiology data pertaining to service demand and patient
    complexity factors (age, mobility and infectiousness) and incorporated
    it into discrete event simulation (DES) model of CT (Computed
    Tomography) services in a diagnostic imaging department. The validated
    simulation provides a decision support tool for managers and policy
    makers.  This presentation describes how simulation can facilitate data
    driven change of work practices and policies, allowing for better
    utilisation of limited resources; and shows some of the practical
    challenges encountered.

    Mary Conlon is a clinical radiographer (HSE) and 4th year PhD student
    (NUIG): Modelling the radiology service, creating a decision support
    tool and simulating alternative service delivery
    options.

- Truls Flatberg: **The value of simple models**

    In a highly complex and networked world, operations research models are
    also increasing in size and complexity. This trend makes models harder
    to understand for users, tending to decrease their confidence in the
    model and its results. In this talk I will focus on the value of simple
    models, illustrated by a real-world example from the aluminium industry.
    Even though being limited in scope, these simpler models present
    benefits in terms of securing user confidence and being computationally
    easy, allowing fast feedback in a distributed
    setting.

    Truls Flatberg is a researcher at SINTEF Industry working on applying
    operations research technology to create a better
    society.

- Ine Steenmans:  **Behind-the-Scenes: current OR in the UK Government's Industrial Strategy**

    People love the idea of systems thinking. OR analysts practise the
    principles of systems thinking. And governments are increasingly
    (re)appreciating the value of systems thinking. But when it comes to what
    it really looks like when a government uses OR tools for systems mapping on
    real policy problems, it is infrequent that we actually get access to the
    details 'behind-the-scenes'. In this talk I'll share a few views into
    ongoing work using systems mapping for the UK's Industrial Strategy.
    Specifically, the UK has embraced the idea of 'missions' to inspire
    government and business to work across sectors and regions to achieve  bold
    and inspiring goals (inspired by Kennedy's prompt to US industry and
    research to 'get a man on the moon'!). OR tools are being used to make
    sense of what such a mission looks like in the world today.

    Ine is a practice-based researcher in Futures and Analytics for policy at
    University College London (UCL). She looks at the practical ways OR tools
    and analytics are used to make sense of big, messy policy issues.

- Georgio Sartor: **The hotspot problem**

    In Air Traffic Management, a hotspot represents a region of the
    airspace in which too many airplanes are scheduled to fly through. The
    Hotspot Problem (HP) consists of determining new (possibly delayed)
    departure times for all flights to get a hotspot free schedule with
    minimum total
    delay.

    The capacity of a region is related to the workload of air traffic
    controllers, and its duration: controllers can only sustain a heavy
    workload (i.e., several airplanes) for a short time. A light workload
    (i.e., only a few airplanes) can be sustained throughout the entire
    day.

    Current methods measure workload over fixed windows of time, causing a
    phenomenon called "bunching": excess airplanes from a time-window are
    simply moved to the beginning of the next time-window.  This talk shows
    how a novel approach, sliding time-windows with variable width, both
    prevents bunching and differentiates between peak (small time-window)
    and off-peak (large time-window)
    restrictions.

    Giorgio is a PostDoc Researcher at SINTEF, currently working on
    scheduling/dispatching/timetabling of trains and airplanes. He has a PhD
    in Applied Math from Singapore University of Technology and Design, and
    degrees in Automation Engineering from the University of
    Padua.

- Tom Cnops: **Between optimization and the real world**

    While modelling accuracy is always important, it is especially so when the
    model is not only used to describe but also to prescribe. One of the
    activities at Jeppesen is to help airlines create work schedules (rosters)
    for their crew. As such, the modelled constraints must exactly match what
    both crew and planners expect. The quality of the final product then not
    only depends on the quality of the optimization ("Solving the problem") but
    also on the quality of the implementation ("Solving the right problem").

    Although this is changing now, many airlines still use human intelligence
    in varying degrees to solve the rostering problem. As a result, rigorous
    definitions of the various constraints are usually absent and instead the
    process relies on the interpretation of the planners. This talk will
    discuss several examples where going from an obvious interpretation to a
    comprehensive rule is nontrivial.

    Educated as a metallurgical engineer, Tom got into optimization while
    working on the supply chain of a steel mill. He now works on crew and
    operations management for Jeppesen.

- Marion Penn: **Using generic modelling to increase implementation: advantages and challenges**

    Generic modelling has the potential to significantly reduce the time
    and resources required to create models once the initial model has been
    developed.  This has the potential to increase the use and therefor also
    implementation of OR modelling in a variety of domains.  In healthcare a
    variety of organisations have similar structures, so there should be
    considerable scope for generic modelling to increase the impact of
    modelling.

    This talk will explore the advantages of generic modelling with
    reference to an example from a healthcare context.  It will also
    consider the challenges of generic modelling and examples of steps that
    can be taken to address them.

    Marion Penn works at the University of Southampton within the Wessex
    CALHRC (Centre for Applied Leadership in Health Research and Care),
    applying OR techniques to support research in healthcare
    contexts.

- Gavin Bell: 5 lessons in 5 Minutes for Success in Practice**

    OR in practice, I think, has one very simple goal - take a system or
    process, and make it work a little bit better. Over the past 20 years as
    a practitioner I have made many mistakes in trying to achieve this goal.
    Mostly these were not the result of classical modelling errors or a lack
    of model sophistication, but rather of something more mundane and
    simultaneously more difficult: misunderstanding the system and process,
    and what "making It work a little better" really means.  Fortunately -
    hopefully - I've learned something from these mistakes, and have boiled
    some of my experiences down into 5 lessons for a 5 minute talk: 1. Meet
    your customer's capabilities; 2. Real world systems are compromises; 3.
    Always challenge wishful thinking; 4. Don't let optimality trump
