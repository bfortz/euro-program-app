Since 2009 a charging infrastructure for transportation on the basis of electrified powertrains has been developed all over Europe – partially state subsidised – and is provided by municipal utilities privately as well as publicly. Access to the charging stations is monitored by intelligent Triple-A-Systems (AAA – Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting) for reasons of security, customer loyalty and accounting. These systems are usually regionally operated by different providers, resulting in the development of local charging station networks, which are mostly inaccessible for customers of other providers. Similar to roaming in mobile communications, it should be possible for pioneers of e-mobility to have access to public charging stations of different operators. To achieve this, an interoperability and connection between the numerous charging station management systems has to be created.

The organization of these roads directly influences the performance of the system. This problem is one of the most important issues in designing an AGV (automated guided vehicles) system. This work deals with flow path design problem for a conventional unidirectional network. An efficient optimization method based on ant colony algorithm is developed in order to solve the case of minimizing the total travel distance considering both loaded and empty travels. For this algorithm, each ant constructs a solution moving into the graph. A displacement is allowed only if the nodes are linked and if the segment is not oriented yet. In this case, going from a node i to a node j fixes the segment orientation from i to j. When an ant arrives on a node which all segments linked are already oriented, it is moved on another node to finish his path. Two local searches are applied to the best solution. The first one consists in creating new solutions reversing for each one the direction of one segment of the solution considered. The second one consists in randomly selecting a node linked with at least 4 segments and testing all combinations of the segment direction for this node. If a better solution is found, it will replace the best current solution. To ensure the efficiency of the proposed optimization method, computational experiments are carried out and results are compared with the work of Guan et al. (2011). For all cases tested, the algorithm found optimal solution when it is known, with smaller time of resolution. When it is not the case, it improves the result of the literature with smaller time of resolution or equivalent.

The goal is to find work plans that minimize the total down-time of those sub-networks that have to be shut down for the maintenance operations. Since a job can comprise multiple tasks, minimizing its down-time means to minimize the difference between the earliest start time and the latest completion time among its tasks. This requires a careful scheduling of worker activities with respect to the processing times of maintenance operations, the travel times between geographically dispersed task locations, and the skills of maintenance workers. We propose for this problem two mixed-integer programming models. An arc-based routing model is used in case of a homogeneous worker team whereas a more complex second model also supports heterogeneous workers. For solving large instances of the problem, we combine a Large Neighborhood Search that delivers routes for the workers (sequences of maintenance tasks) with a scheduling stage that is either solved by a forward-backward iteration heuristic or by an exactly solved LP. Both approaches are assessed with respect to the involved computational effort and the achieved solution quality. The complete planning approach is evaluated using data provided by a large electricity company, which operates a network of about 7000 facilities in central Germany.", :title "Down-time minimization in electricity network maintenance", :keyword2 96, :authors (13086 32202), :session 245}, 187 {:keyword1 99, :keyword3 101, :abstract "Saving costs in inventory systems can often only be accomplished by reducing service levels. Allowing lateral transshipments in multi-location inventory networks permits lower levels of safety stock thereby cutting costs while maintaining or improving service levels. Usually, such movements of stock are either carried out in a reactive manner responding to a stock-out in the system, or preventively to rebalance inventory levels. Recent results show that using a hybrid version of these two approaches can yield further improvements. This lies in the fact that shipment costs in many cases consist of a higher fixed and a lower variable part. The rebalancing of inventory levels can thus be achieved at an often negligible additional cost if a reactive transshipment is made. We extend this idea and implement it in a multi-item setup. Our model describes a multi-location inventory network facing compound, non-homogeneous Poisson demand. Instances of demand have an underlying discrete, multivariate distribution. We derive a quasi-myopic policy by applying a dynamic programming policy improvement step to a no-transshipment policy. Transshipment costs are modelled with a knapsack-like structure to accommodate different types of items. We carry out an extensive simulation study to demonstrate the improvement of hybrid lateral transshipments over existing policies. Further, we assess the effect of modelling multi-item transshipments against operating single item models in parallel.", :title "Hybrid lateral transshipments in multi-item inventory networks", :keyword2 76, :authors (29193 10803 32086 356), :session 228}, 188 {:keyword1 106, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We propose the Vehicle Pricing Game (VPG), a noncooperative n-person game addressing the vehicles' viewpoints within a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Each vehicle acts as a player that demands a price per km for carrying out a tour. Based on these prices, a VRP is solved under the objective of minimizing the total routing costs. The profit of each vehicle is dependent on the length of the assigned tour and on the demanded price and expenses. In particular, we address the question which price a vehicle should choose to maximize the own profit, taking into account that the competing vehicles are facing the same objective and that site-dependencies might be established at the nodes. To answer this question, the interplay of the vehicles is studied within a game-theoretic setting. We present theoretical results on existence and computation of equilibria for particular cases of the VPG. Moreover, we provide results of a numerical study that illustrate how site-dependencies influence the solution of a VPG.", :title "Pricing Strategies for the Site-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem", :keyword2 40, :authors (16889), :session 304}, 192 {:keyword1 61, :keyword3 0, :abstract "CMPL is a mathematical programming language and a system for mathematical programming and optimization of linear optimization problems.

In addition, those structures are not static, but change due to planned and perturbation-driven factors. Finally, e.g., in information or energy structures, continuous flows exist. The continuous flows may also exist in the main material process structure, e.g., in gas or petrochemical SCs. Although the research on scheduling of discrete flows in SCs has been significantly advanced in recent years, the research on continuous flows and structural integration is rather limited. Based on the previously developed approach to structure dynamics control of SCs, we present in this study an SC scheduling model for continuous flows and exemplify structural interrelations on the integration of material and informational structures. The model is based on a combination of optimal program control and mathematical programming interrelated by Pontryagin’s maximum principle.

A coalition Nash equilibrium for a strategic game consists of (1) a subset $S$ of players, (2) independent mixed strategies for each member of $S$, (3) the conjecture of the actions for the other players not in $S$ with the condition that each member of $S$ maximises his/her expected payoff according to the product of all mixed strategies for $S$ and the other players' conjecture. This paper stands on the Bayesian point of view as follows: The players start with the same prior distribution on a state-space.  In addition they have private information which is given by a partition of the state space. Each player in a coalition $S$ predicts the other players' actions as the posterior of the others' actions given his/her information.  He/she communicates privately their beliefs about the other players' actions through messages among all members in $S$ according to the communication network in $S$, which message is  information about his/her individual conjecture about the others' actions. \r\nThe recipients  update their belief by the messages. Precisely, at every stage each player communicates privately not only his/her belief about the others' actions but also his/her rationality as  messages according to a protocol and then the recipient  updates their private\r\ninformation and revises her/his prediction.

Orders backordered incur a backorder cost while orders rejected incur a lost sales cost. The objective is to minimize the sum of inventory holding cost and the costs of backorders and lost sales. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and use this formulation to characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal policy can be described by two threshold functions that depend on the level of backorders from the patient class. These threshold functions specify (1) when it is optimal to produce, (2) how to allocate units produced to either increase inventory or reduce backorder, and (3) when to fulfill orders from on-hand inventory and when to backorder (in the case of the patient class) and when to reject them (in the case of the impatient class). We show that the priority in inventory allocation among the two classes is not static and instead depends on the backorder level from the class of patient customers. In particular, it is possible to start out fulfilling orders from the impatient class and backordering orders from the patient class and then to switch to fulfilling orders from the patient class and rejecting orders from the impatient class.

Despite the empirical importance of load forecasting, and the high operational cost associated with forecast errors, the potential benefits of segmenting time series into subseries have not been evaluated in an empirical comparison. This paper assesses the empirical accuracy of segmenting empirical hourly load data taken from the UK into daily subseries versus forecasting the original, continuous time series with NNs.

Types with higher quality characteristics can be used as substitutes for lower ones and thus are more flexible.\r\nAt the company, which motivated this research, the task of the fleet management team is to secure the supply with rail cars while at the same time optimally solve the trade-off between (i) minimizing the cost for rail cars and (ii) minimizing the number of different rail car types. A small set of different rail car types enables a parking strategy where the types are sorted by track. This keeps the handling easy. As the number grows, space limitations require a chaotic parking strategy. This causes an increase in the switching effort for providing a certain type. Further, the smaller the number of different types, the smaller the required safety stock due to a larger risk pooling effect. These benefits have to be traded off against the higher cost for more flexible rail car types.\r\nWe develop a mathematical model that provides a suggestion for how to design the rail car fleet in terms of structure and size in order to solve the above-mentioned trade-off.

They also restore the corresponding machine to be \"as good as new\", but a preventive maintenance action results in a shorter downtime of the machine as a corrective maintenance action.\r\nIn this paper a model is derived to allocate an order of n jobs to the machines and build a schedule for the jobs and preventive maintenance activities.

This causes a deviation from the competitive equilibrium and leads to higher market prices, a decrease of total output, a reduction of social welfare and its redistribution to the benefit of producers and to the detriment of consumers. We consider the issue of increasing the efficiency of the electricity market with the purpose of minimizing the ability of deviation from the optimal market state. Standard measures of antitrust regulation (such as splitting the generating sector into smaller companies) are not always justified; therefore, we investigate the introduction of forward market as an alternative way to reduce market power.\r\n   We construct and examine a two-stage model of the market, taking into account the presence of arbitrageurs. A symmetric oligopoly with a fixed marginal cost is considered as a market structure. Each consumer is described with a reserve price and a parameter of risk attitude. The main contribution is a consideration of a random factor that affects the outcome in the spot market.\r\n   We determine agents' strategies that correspond to the subgame perfect equilibrium depending on the parameters of the model. We compare the subgame perfect equilibrium with the Nash equilibrium of a one-stage model. The results show that market power decreases with the growth of the probability of the outcome with a low spot price and the fraction of risk preferring consumers.

Technological restrictions may reduce the set of feasible schedules even more. As an example transportation limitations are presented, so that the products are only moved from one station to the next at the end of a cycle; the cycle time is the maximum of the durations of the jobs in a cycle. A survey about existing algorithms solving the no-buffer flow-shop scheduling problem is presented; normally the makespan is minimised. Since this scheduling problem is integrated in the usual hierarchical planning, the tardiness is minimised. This NP-hard problem is solved by priority rules, identified as successful in literature, because of a high number of jobs and an addressed dynamic environment. Due to the load-restriction, the duration of a job A on the flow-shop depends on the other jobs processed on the flow-shop in the same cycle. Realistic processing times are achieved by a simulation of the scheduling of A which includes the next jobs until A has left the flow-shop. The usage of such realistic processing times instead of net processing times improves the priority rules by around 16%. Experiments show that a class of rules achieves a small value of the average tardiness, but under high pressure produces very large delays of a small fraction of the jobs. Another class avoids excessive delays at the expense of a markedly increased average tardiness. With exponential weighting of the slack the best results are achieved. There are pools of jobs where a large variance of the cycle times is beneficial and pools of jobs where a small variance is better. This is partially detected even by the best rule.

We are given a finite set of elements and a set of feasible solutions composed of some subsets of the element set. In the deterministic case, each element has a nonnegative cost and we seek a feasible solution whose total cost is minimal. This formulation encompasses a large class of problems, in particular the important network problems such as the shortest path, minimum spanning tree or minimum assignment.  In real life the precise values of the element costs are often not known in advance. To model this uncertainty, we can introduce a scenario set which contains a finite number of distinct cost vectors, called scenarios. Thus each scenario represents a possible realization of the element costs which may appear with a positive but perhaps unknown probability. In order to choose a solution the ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator (shortly OWA), introduced by Yager in 1988, is used. In particular, the OWA operator contains the max, min, average, median and Hurwicz criteria as special cases. Unfortunately, for most problems, for example the basic network problems, minimizing OWA is NP-hard even for two scenarios. In this paper we provide some general positive and negative approximation results for the considered problem. Namely, we show that if the weights of the scenarios are nonincreasing, then the problem has a simple approximation algorithm with a guaranteed performance bound. On the other hand, if the weights of the scenarios are nondecreasing, then the problem is not at all approximable.

This act envisions the location planning for general practitioners and medical specialists by authorized certification committees. Hence, in the near future physicians are not free to choose the location of their medical practice. Therefore, we propose a multi-period facility location model. The objective of our mixed integer program is to minimize (i) the periodised fixed locational cost (including subsidies in order to enhance the willingness of the physicians to locate in rural areas), (ii) the transport cost of patients, and (iii) the opportunity cost of patients due to potential latency of appointments.  In each period the locations of general practitioners and medical specialists are planned such that the capacities of the facilities are met and that each demand point (containing the population) is assigned to at least one general practitioner and medical specialist. If the total demand at a facility exceeds a certain level, waiting times for appointments occur. Because of our objective function, there is a tradeoff between transport cost and opportunity cost due to latency of appointments in terms of the assignment of demand points to facilities: It might be cost efficient to assign a certain demand point to a facility that is located more distant but the waiting time for an appointment is lower at this facility.

We then analytically relate the models to each other. In this context, we focus on upgrading in the airline industry, where the upgrade decision is made individually for each leg a passenger’s itinerary consists of.

It is necessary, that different products are transported separately from each other because they require different transport conditions (e.g. different temperatures) and/or because they cannot be mixed due to their consistency (e.g. liquid or bulk products). Consequently, it is possible to separate a vehicle’s loading area (capacity) into several compartments such that different products can be transported at the same time, which would allow for a reduction of transportation costs. It has to be decided how the available capacity should be divided into compartments and which routes are to be taken in order to serve all customers, such that the total costs of transportation are minimized. \r\nFor the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem a new optimization model will be proposed, which allows for solving small problem instances to optimality by means of commercial LP solvers. Furthermore, a variable neighborhood search algorithm will be described. The performances of both, the model and the algorithm, have been evaluated in extensive numerical experiments and the corresponding results will be presented.", :title "A new mathematical model and a variable neighborhood search algorithm for the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem", :keyword2 77, :authors (30374 333), :session 302}, 339 {:keyword1 29, :keyword3 102, :abstract "In this talk we consider a general energy planning problem as an extension of the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP). Where the UCP focuses on the commitment and the economic dispatch of large electricity generating entities (units), we add small scale distributed generation, distributed storage and demand side management possibilities to this problem. Hereby we shift the focus of the optimization problem towards the decentralization occuring within Smart Grids. The resulting general energy planning problem differs from the UCP in size and in objective. We treat significantly more appliances and use a combination of objectives to include different types of generators and appliances.\r\nThe general energy planning problem is solved using a hierarchical structure.  In the top level next to the large generators of the UCP also large groups of small scale distributed generators are incorporated by considering them as one entity. A more detailed planning for these groups is done in the lower levels of the hierarchical structure. In these levels also the distributed storage and the demand side management options are taken into account. The general framework consists of creating patterns for single entities/appliances, combining patterns for such appliances on higher levels into so-called aggregated patterns, and using these aggregated patterns to solve a global planning problem on the top level. This process is organized in an iterative way. Two different case studies show the applicability of the method.\r\n", :title "Integrating small scale distributed energy generation, storage and demand side management in the unit commitment problem", :keyword2 96, :authors (8513 26519 26517 26520 26521), :session 289}, 340 {:keyword1 65, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Outsourcing of logistic processes is a major topic for decision makers in logistic departments. The scope of outsourcing comprises besides short-term, transactional transportation orders even long-term contractual agreements with logistic service providers, also termed as contract logistics. But in case several logistic service providers should be selected for full-truck loads (FTL) and less-than-full truck loads (LTL) in inbound or outbound logistics partioning (or bundling) of areas is required. One possibility to do this is to apply methods from classical facility location planning to determine appropriate areas, and then auction off these areas separately. In addition to this common practice, we explore the following approach: just define smaller, mid-size areas and then do a combinatorial auction. Combinatorial auction is an auction format where bidders can apply for bundles of services (areas). This allows logistic service providers to price preferred areas more precisely and to be more competitive. Another advantage is that most players in the logistic market are small and medium sized companies and this auction format allows them to take part in this auction, which originally motivated this research. But bidding in this auction is more complex since the possibilities for bundles are exponential. Due to cognitive limits of bidders it is expected that each bidder only submits only a few bids. Expecting this behavior this can weaken the advantage of combinatorial auction. Contingent bids can help at this point to express in a comprehensive way a range of bids. We model the bidder’s problem of how to find optimal bids and also give a model formulation for the auctioneer winner determination problem.

For each arriving aircraft it is necessary to decide how to handle the transfer luggage. After the unloading of the bags from the aircraft the bags are transported with vehicles to entry points to the airport infrastructure. For each trip it is necessary to choose the best entry point. We consider an airport setup where several entry points in the internal transportation system on the infrastructure level, e.g. a conveyor belt system, exist. The selected entry point has critical influence on the overall connection time for each piece of luggage. For every connecting bag the connection time depends on the position of the arriving aircraft, the selected entry point and the handling location from the outbound flight. Since each connection has another available time period for the connection process, it is important to find a good assignment of the different trips to the entry points in such a way that as many bags as possible hold their connection.\r\nIn this work we show a static mixed integer model for the presented problem. The model can be solved with a standard commercial solver. The objective function combines several criteria in linear objective. The most important one is to minimize missed connections.

In this setting, forecasting is useful to inform sellers and support pricing decisions. Previous research has concentrated on explanatory modeling approaches. Compared to predictive modeling, explanatory models allow testing the influence of, e.g., car features or economic condition on market prices, but sacrifice some accuracy. This paper focuses on predictive modeling to study the extent to which market prices are actually predictable. Using a collection of real-world data sets from a leading German car manufacturer, a large empirical benchmarking study is undertaken to contrast the predictive power of alternative modeling techniques. These include several individual prediction methods and different regimes for forecast combination. Furthermore, the study sheds light on the specificity of resale price forecasting models. On the one hand, one can build a single model for all vehicles. Alternatively, individual models for different brands or different car models can be built. Forecasting at lower granularity is likely to improve forecast accuracy but at the cost of multiplying the number of models and thus the effort of creating and monitoring these models. It is therefore important to appraise the trade-off between accuracy and specificity to clarify the marginal utility of forecasting at lower granularity and provide recommendation how the forecasting task should be approached in corporate practice.

Thus, for any two classes C and D, either every or no member of C has a neighbor in D. The relationships between the classes can hence be visualized by a graph, the so-called role graph.

Mathematical models of the public service system design problem are often related to the p-median problem, where the numbers of serviced customers and possible service center locations take the value of several thousands. The number of possible locations impacts the computational time for solving the associated mathematical programming problem. The necessity of solving large instances of the p-median problem has led to the approximate approach based on a set-covering formulation, which enables to solve bigger instances in admissible time making use of a universal IP-solver. This approach pays for shorter computational time or smaller demanded computer memory by a loss of accuracy. The accuracy can be improved by a more suitable determination of dividing points, which are used for a network distance approximation. This contribution deals with the idea that some network distances from customer to possible center locations can be considered relevant. These distances are expected to belong to the optimal solution. The p-1 largest distances from a customer to all possible service center locations represent an example of non-relevant distances.

In this context, it is assumed that all supply chain parties are strictly (expected) profit maximizing and, therefore, sensible to even arbitrarily small pay-off differences between contract alternatives. However, previous behavioral work on contracting under asymmetric information in supply chains shows that agents (buyers) are not always strictly profit maximizing, but sometimes tend to choose contracts that have only a minor impact on their own performance but a substantially negative impact on the principal’s (supplier’s) and the overall supply chain’s performance. Thus, these studies indicate that the buyers are in fact not strictly but only nearly profit maximizing when making their contract choices. The present work relaxes the assumption of the strictly profit maximizing buyer in a serial supply chain for a lotsizing framework with asymmetrically distributed holding cost information and deterministic end-customer demand. The study provides researchers and managers an approach on how to account for the buyer’s insensitivity to arbitrarily small pay-off differences while providing a solution method for the resulting non-linear mathematical program. A numerical study compares the advantages of the “behavioral robust” contract assuming only nearly profit maximizing buyers against the classical screening contract assuming strictly profit maximizing buyers.

To fill this gap, we develop an extension of the static game to modelling highly polarized conflicts in an uncertain, asymmetric and dynamic environment.

If a negotiation breakdown occurs, each party learns about these threats from the outcome observed in the previous round.

The objective of the problem is to minimize three major costs, fixed costs of LBBs, periodic delivery costs, and emergency referral deliver costs.

This assumption may be reasonable in the very short-term. However, this is no longer the case if current short-term decisions strategically interact with short-term decisions in future periods. For example, a current decision on the operating mode of a production process may influence future choices of the operating mode whenever switching between operating modes is costly. In this case it may be worthwhile to forego some certain short-term profits if this loss is over-compensated by an increase in next period’s expected profits. If such interactions are neglected in short-term decision making, the long term results may be suboptimal even though all short-terms decision are optimized with regard to current revenues and costs. In this paper we apply real options methodology to short-term decision making. We show that managerial flexibility to switch between operating modes creates additional opportunity costs and benefits for short-term decisions. We demonstrate how real options methodology helps identifying the optimal short-term operations with respect to the interactions of current and future decisions under uncertainty.

Thus, these schedules might lead to a local optimum of an objective pursued by the supply chain. Further improvements of the operational supply chain performance might be achieved by an integrated consideration of operations. The integrated production and transport scheduling problem (PTSP) can be formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP). The MIP comprises binary optimization variables that represent assignments, e.g. orders to machines or trucks, as well as continuous optimization variables like time and costs. Since it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, exact solutions are limited to small problem instances. This paper introduces a heuristic approach for the solution of the MIP based on a genetic algorithm that allows solving problem instances of practically relevant size. Here, the problem is split into two subproblems which can be tackled by different solution techniques. The first subproblem deals with the binary variables, which represent the genomes in the genetic algorithm. However, the number of binary variables leads to a very large solution space. Therefore, by using dependencies between binary variables we limit the number of variables that are mutated, whereas the remaining variables are determined in a deterministic way. For a given genome, a configuration of the binary variables, the remaining optimization subproblem is a linear program (LP) which can be solved efficiently in the worst case. Thus, the optimal value of the objective function from the LP represents the value of the fitness function in each iteration of the genetic algorithm.

The heat demand is covered by nine thermal power plants all working according to the principle of combined heat and power production. This permits a fuel utilisation factor higher than for separate generation of heat and power, but also implicates a lower flexibility since the heat and power load cannot be adjusted independently. On the one hand the heat load dependent power loss factor in extraction-condensing turbines causes a profit loss in times of high electricity prices. On the other hand the need to cover the heat demand also forces plants to be kept on stream during times of low power prices which causes an increase of costs.\r\nDistrict heating accumulators may represent an expedient solution to this issue, as they may help to partly or entirely decouple electricity production from heat demand. More electrical energy could be marketed in periods of high electricity prices if the heat production of a cogeneration plant could be temporarily decoupled from heat demand by way of using a heat accumulator. In addition load setbacks could be performed for unprofitable units at times of low power prices, provided the buffer is sufficiently sized to close the gap in heat supply.\r\nIn order to optimize the number and type of heat accumulators, their locations within the district heating grid, their volumes and operating temperatures Vattenfall uses both the commercial dispatch tool BOFIT and an in cooperation with TU Berlin developed mixed integer program, formulated in GAMS and solved with CPLEX.

The item has a critical importance in military operations and it is supplied by a single domestic supplier. In the current system, there is a two-echelon inventory setting which consists of a single stock point, the central depot, in the upper echelon and several stock points, the bases, in the lower echelon. The users are the military units which are very close to the operation sites. The demand originates from the item failures in the users, which are regarded as the end customers, and it is modeled as a Poisson process. \r\nThe depot replenishes the bases and orders from an outside supplier. The depot and the bases are connected via military ring services. Any unsatisfied demand is backordered at all stock points. The lead times are assumed to be deterministic. A continuous review base-stock policy is used by all facilities.  The goal is to operate the inventory control system at the minimum expected long run average cost. \r\nThe military headquarters responsible for inventory management identified improvement opportunities such as acquiring repair ability and changing the structure of the supply chain from a two-echelon model to a single echelon model. Considering these opportunities, we investigate four different alternative inventory systems, single-echelon and two echelon models with or without repair ability.

Since repositioning a single vessel can cost hundreds of thousands of US dollars, optimizing the repositioning activities of vessels is an important problem to the liner shipping industry.\r\n\r\nThe Liner Shipping Fleet Repositioning Problem (LSFRP) consists of finding routes that reposition (move) vessels between services in a liner shipping network while respecting the cargo flows of the network. The LSFRP maximizes the profit earned on the subset of the liner shipping network affected by the repositioning, taking into account sailing costs, loading/unloading costs, port fees, and cargo/equipment revenues. Repositioning problems are subject to a number of constraints on how vessels can be moved within the network, such as ensuring that vessels joining a new service have a weekly temporal spacing, i.e. each vessel visits a particular port one week after the previous vessel. Despite its great industrial importance, the LSFRP has received little attention in the literature.

Counteractions to these imbalances are required for ensuring that a sufficient number of bikes and racks are available in order to satisfy customer demands. The most important countermeasure is relocation of free bikes by means of service vehicles at regular time intervals. However, operating service vehicles tends to be cost-intensive.

The authors assume a bid of a producer to be a monotone smooth function and a demand function to depend on a random parameter. For each peremeter value the cut-off price is determined as equalizing  aggregate supply function and current demand function. A bid profile is a supply function equilibrium (SFE) if it induces Nash equilibrium for each parameter value.  SFE price is always less than Cournot oligopoly price. For some cases, the price reduction is considerable (Newbery, 1998), so the supply function auction model predicts market power reduction.\r\nHowever, computation of SFE bids is rather sophisticated mathematical problem. In general, its solution requires full information on the demand function and cost functions of all competitors. Why should one expect that actual behavior at the auction corresponds to this concept? The answer to a similar question for Nash equilibria of normal form games is given in the framework of adaptive and learning mechanisms' investigation. \r\nWe consider best reply dynamics for the repeated auction game for two variants of a symmetric oligopoly with a linear demand function: 1) with linear marginal cost, 2) with constant marginal cost and capacity constraint.

In perfect market segmentation customers associated with a market segment do not cannibalize (move) between market segments. However, it is not uncommon to notice that the market segmentation a firm exercises is seldom prefect, and due to imperfect segmentation customers cannibalize between market segments which is also referred as demand leakage.

The task is now to find a cost minimal collection of containers and a feasible assignment of the demand to all selected containers.\r\n\r\nFrom theoretical point of view, by exploring similarities to the well known set cover problem, we derive NP-hardness and  see that the non-approximability result known for set cover also carries over to our problem.\r\n\r\nFor practical applications we need very fast heuristics to be integrated into a meta-heuristic framework that – depending on the context - either provide feasible near optimal solutions or  only estimate cost value of an optimal solution. Thus, in a second part we develop and analyse a flexible family of greedy algorithms that meet these challenges.  In order to find best-performing configurations for different requirements of the meta-heuristic framework, we provide an extensive computational study on random and real world instance sets obtained from our project partner 4flow.\r\n\r\nWe outline a trade-off between running times and solution quality and conclude that the proposed methods achieve the accuracy and efficiency necessary for serving as a key ingredient in more complex meta-heuristics.", :title "A Multi-Dimensional Multi-Commodity Covering Problem with Application in Logistics", :keyword2 106, :authors (33307 17134 26508), :session 211}, 432 {:keyword1 106, :keyword3 59, :abstract "The determination of flow through a network is an important planning task in transportation. Typically, it is necessary to determine paths of several assets through a given network in parallel. This is called multi-commodity network flow planning. Often, the underlying application requires coordination among the paths of different commodities (arrival or departure times or locations). Such coordination is called synchronization. We address a multi-commodity network flow problem in which a synchronisation of nodes contained in the determined paths and the arrival times at these “shared nodes” are necessary. A set of N ordered pairs of nodes of a network is given. Each pair represents the demand for transport from the first node in the pair to the second node in the pair. A finite set of vehicles is available to serve this need and n of the N pairs must be served by two or more vehicles. Thus, a multi-commodity network flow problem must be solved to determine exactly one path for each vehicle so that (i) each given pair is contained in at least one path and (ii) at least n pairs are contained in at least two paths and (iii) if a pair is served by several vehicles then their service times must fall into an implicit time window. The here reported research aims at generating parameterizable test instances for a network capacity control problem in road-based freight transportation. We present a mixed-integer linear program for the outlined network flow determination task. Since even small instances of this model turn out to be computationally intractable for mathematical solvers like CPLEX, we configure a genetic search approach to seek for feasible solutions of the proposed model.

This paper presents results of a case study of the current operational principles of cross-border trade between Russian energy+capacity market and Nord Pool energy-only market. The principles of the physical electricity trading in the Nordic and Russian markets are different. In the Nordic market, electricity is traded only in the day-ahead spot-market. In Russia, the electricity market comprises two elements: the day-ahead spot-market and the capacity market.  Even though the electricity price in Nord Pool has been higher that the electricity price in Russian market, electricity flow at the cross-border interconnection has been reduced as a result of the profit maximization task of the cross border trader. In this paper, the optimal strategy of the cross-border trader operating in two markets with different designs will be shown by calculating the optimal electricity flows at different price levels.

Within the terminal the container yard serves as a temporary buffer where incoming containers are piled up in stacks. Outgoing containers need to be transported from the yard to a ship or to trucks in predefined sequences. Generally, the retrieval sequence does not match the stacking order within the yard. Since only the topmost container of each stack can be accessed, containers stored above it must be relocated first. A common procedure is to relocate containers within one bay (row of container stacks) since relocations between bays are very time consuming. In order to minimize turnaround times, a move sequence to retrieve containers from the bay in the prescribed order with a minimum number of reshuffles has to be determined. This problem is known as the container relocation problem (CRP) and is known to be NP-hard. \r\n\r\nWe present a column generation approach for this problem. The master problem represents the bay layout over time with two sets of variables. State variables indicate the position of each container in the bay over time. Each movement variable represents a series of movements to retrieve exactly one container and to relocate containers stacked above it. The subproblem uses complete enumeration enhanced with bounding mechanisms to choose movement variables with negative reduced costs. Experiments are conducted for an exact method of the subproblem and for a heuristic variant of the exact method.

First, we formulate a new binary integer linear program for the integrated solution of the berth allocation and quay crane assignment problems called BACAP.

Computational experiments performed on problem instances of various sizes indicate that the model for BACAP is very efficient and even large instances up to 60 vessels can be solved to optimality. Unfortunately, this is not the case for BACASP and only small instances can be solved optimally. To be able to solve large instances, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for generating an optimal solution of BACASP from an optimal solution of BACAP using a postprocessing algorithm. We also develop a cutting plane algorithm for the case where this condition is not satisfied. This algorithm solves BACAP repeatedly by adding cuts generated from the optimal solutions at each trial until the aforementioned condition holds.

One of the first schemes of blind equalization is the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) which is known to be robust and requires simple hardware implementation. \r\nHowever, for quadrature amplitude modulations (QAM), used in high data-rate communications, the CMA leads to not sufficiently low residual errors for a correct recovering of transmitted signals. Other algorithms like the multi-modulus algorithm (MMA) and the extended CMA (ECMA) have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Unfortunately, for high-order QAM modulations, even these algorithms are unable to provide low residual ISI. Hence, hybrid approaches combining the CMA (MMA or ECMA) cost function with a term based on alphabet-matching functions (AMF), have been proposed and the stochastic gradient algorithm used to minimize the resulting cost function. The idea is that the CM term governs the initial equalization phase, and that the AM term can provide a more accurate final equalization. \r\n Our contribution presents a scheme based on the combination of the ECMA and a modified version of a Gaussian AM criterion.

The tariff entitled to a particular plant of the firm is decided by a regulatory authority and comprises of a capacity component and an energy component. The former is a function of the plant utilization and the fixed costs associated with the plant among others. The energy component of tariff is independent of plant utilization and is a function of coal cost. This coal cost is based on the prices of a bundle of different types of coal and the utility firm could improve its profitability by using a higher proportion of cheaper coal. The optimization model is one of maximizing the surplus of the firm. The surplus function comprises of a (i) revenue component, (ii) coal cost component, (iii) coal freight cost component and (iv) other variable costs component. The decision variable is the amount of power that should be generated at a particular plant using coal of a particular coal source. The revenue component is a non-linear function up to given plant utilization level. The various cost components described above and constraints are linear. Objective function representing the surplus of the firm is a non-linear function. The non-linearity of the objective function results in difficulty to estimate the global optima.

Additionally, different indicators are considered for building robust schedules, such as additional buffer times, the number of different crew duties per vehicle, and the expected propagation of delays. The expected propagation of delays is taken into account within and between vehicle blocks and crew duties. As vehicles and crews are scheduled simultaneously the mutual dependencies between vehicles and drivers can be considered to minimize the overall propagation of delays within the transport network. Further, the approaches take advantage of the underlying time-space-network model. The model allows us to compute a flow solution that represents a bundle of feasible, cost efficient vehicle schedules. From the bundle of vehicle schedules we can obtain the one that minimizes the delay propagation best in interaction with the crew schedule.

Customers order a number of tubes with a desired length and diameter. These tubes are the output material of a complex production process. With the length and the diameter as input parameters the needed lengths of input material can be calculated. Due to several degrees of freedom within the production process it is possible to produce the same output with different lengths of input material the so-called alternative cutting lengths. For example, it is possible to fulfil customer order A with 10 pieces of input length X or with 14 pieces of input length Y. Aggravating, the relation between the desired output and the possible input lengths gets lost during the production process. That means, that the cutting department only knows the number and lengths of the needed input material in total but they do not know what output will be produced with the cutting lengths.\r\nThe general problem is a classic one-dimensional cutting stock problem which can be solved by several well known algorithms that lead to good results in an acceptable computational time.

In option pricing, numerical analytical approaches of partial differential equation (PDE) such as FEM or finite difference method (FDM) are mainly used.  However, these methods have a drawback that the actual computation time becomes longer exponentially as the dimension of the PDE increases.  Due to recent developments of multi-dimensional options, it is necessary for these methods to reduce the computation time.  In this study, we provide the endogenous method that determines element lengths from the curvature of the PDE in order to improve the computational performance.  Although there are many studies on option pricing using FEM, they use a priori determined element lengths.  Therefore, attempting in various combinations of element lengths is needed to gain more precise solutions.  Our method consists of two algorithms, element length expanding and redivision algorithms.  By using these two algorithms, the model endogenously makes the element length larger if the curvature of the local analytical domain is low, and smaller if that is high at each time step.\r\nIn this study, we apply this method to one-dimensional options in order to investigate how much the experiment time is reduced.  We employ an up-and-out call option which has high curvature around the strike price and the barrier so that the efficiency of our method can be measured.

The decision maker is assumed as risk-averse, but it is argued in the paper why in many cases, risk aversion in public health will only refer to total cost but not to total effect. Under this assumption, a recent theoretical stochastic-dominance result is used to show that in the obtained multi-objective stochastic optimization model, the random variables for cost and for effect can be suitably decoupled even in the presence of stochastic dependence. Extending a mean-risk model (as usual in financial portfolio optimization) for the cost objective by the addition of the effect objective, we arrive at a three-objective mean-mean-risk model for which the Pareto frontier can be determined as a tool to give practical decision support. We apply the approach to a more special type of health programme portfolio selection problems investigated before by Al, Feenstra and van Hout ( 2005) and other authors, and illustrate by a concrete example how the proposed technique works. As a risk measure, absolute semideviation (and a measure derived from it) and budget overrun probability are used alternatively. It turns out that the semideviation-based choice can lead to a degeneration of the Pareto frontier to a curve for which only expected cost and expected QALYs count, whereas this does typically not happen for the second, more conservative measure depending on a budget limit.

There are several reasons why the energetic use of biomass is often associated with sustainability, e.g., the less contribution to climate change or the preservation of fossil energy reserves.\r\nNevertheless, the public perception of the energetic use of biomass has recently been characterized by decreasing acceptance. Major concerns are that monocultures will increase due to a higher demand for energy crops, which would result in massive land-use changes and affect biodiversity. In addition, an increase in transport activity is expected in rural areas, aggravating air pollution and disturbance. Moreover, the designation of areas for energy crop production is a highly controversial issue from an ethical perspective, especially in cases where areas are used for food production, nature conservation or grassland.\r\nHence, it becomes apparent that the assessment of potential concepts for the energetic use of biomass is of multidimensional nature and should not only imply economic, but also environmental, social and technical aspects. For that reason, methods of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) seem to be suitable for assessing potential concepts of biomass-usage.\r\nAn approach, based on the multi-criteria method PROMETHEE, has been developed, which allows an assessment of three different concepts: Small-scale and large-scale biogas plants, as well as bioenergy villages.

In this talk, a real-world production process is considered that can be modeled as a single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times. Moreover, inventory constraints for needed components and materials are integrated. Two different objectives are pursued and evaluated. In order to provide a high service level demanded by the customers, the first objective function pursues the minimization of the total weighted tardiness. Alternatively, by minimizing the total weighted completion time, the second objective function seeks the finding of schedules that attain large throughputs with a high production efficiency. In order to generate optimal schedules, we propose a new sophisticated branch and bound approach.

Several mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models exist to load containers on trains. Although the general model structure is similar, motorail train loading differs strongly from container loading due to certain technical requirements. In contrast to recent work on auto-carrier loading we consider route specific requirements and physical constraints in more detail and additionally focus on order acceptance in a dynamic environment. Particularly the integration of the booking process distinguishes our approach from previous ones. Orders are placed at different points of time and must be accepted or rejected immediately, so the problem has to be solved repeatedly with varying information. Optimal train utilization can be achieved by the suggested MILP model if vehicle specifications are exactly known. During the booking process decisions have to be made immediately for each arriving booking request. In practice, the frequent use of an optimization model is impossible because of long runtimes and the missing integration in current booking systems. Hence, it is necessary to identify risks and chances in advance to control available capacity. We propose a MILP model which determines maximum weights for all possible vehicle specifications to decide optimally about the acceptance of orders and compare this approach with a simple heuristic method by a simulation study. The proposed models can be solved using standard commercial software as well as open source software.

To ensure continuous production, perpetual physical stocktaking is also allowed. The problem of the inventory manager is to decide, when which item has to be counted under a certain objective function. Under HGB, each item has to counted at least once a year. Assuming that the demand of the product is not constant over the year (e.g. there could be cyclical demand), each item should be counted at it’s expected date of minimum inventory level.

So far it is not as much focused on the question to what extend the currently incurring deliveries can be avoided or can be organized in another way, without resulting in significant disadvantages for retail trade though.

A careful planning of the charging decisions is thus very important with EVs. When dealing with charging decisions, the interplay between charge and travel time introduces an additional layer of complexity. For example, at some point taking a longer but more energy-efficient route might allow to globally save time, because charging can be delayed or avoided. Due to these interactions, traditional routing approaches with separate charging planning are not well suited for EVs.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents a method for devising efficient travel plans for a set of sequential trips.

However, it is notoriously difficult to accurately forecast renewable electricity sources like wind and solar production with the granularity that energy providers require. To compensate for the fluctuating production and forecast errors, energy providers have to use expensive control energy. This partly negates the positive effect of renewables. Various ideas for load smoothing on the production side have been suggested. Here, we focus on load shifting on the consumer side: electricity rates that may vary in hourly intervals can influence smart devices in private consumer households. With real-time pricing (RTP) the energy provider can send high prices when production is behind forecasts. On the other hand, prices should be cheap when the production exceeds the forecast. Cheap rates would incite electricity consumptions.\r\nThe challenge is to identify the price signal that will result in the desired load shift at consumers. As the behavior of smart devices is still unknown today we use a simulation prototype and train an artificial neural network with simulation data. As it turns out the neural network leads to good results and achieves hit rates in the task of mapping the desired load shift to a price signal. This hit rate only slightly decreases when we submit the price model to some constraints that increase consumer-friendliness. The advantage of using a neural network is that it can adapt to a slowly changing mix of smart devices in households.

Assuming a uniform network we analytically derive the formula estimating the relation between the minimum coupling strength required to ensure frequency synchronization and the network parameters. This minimum value can be efficiently found by solving a binary optimization problem, even for large networks, using universal solver XPRESS. The accuracy of the analytical estimation we validate by comparing it with numerical simulations on a realistic network describing the European interconnected high-voltage electricity system, finding good agreement. Repeatedly solving the binary optimization problem we can test the stability of the frequency synchronization with respect to link removals.

Optimal rosters are characterized by minimal number of unassigned duties, minimal difference of overtime among all drivers, and maximal satisfaction of drivers. One of the common preferences of drivers is to get similar duties within a working week. Basically, we define similar duties as those duties which contain a large amount of equal (sub-)sequences of service trips.\r\nUsually public transport companies face a problem when the vehicle and crew scheduling problems of different days are solved with state-of-the-art optimization methods: as some trips are not serviced every day, cost efficient duties computed for one day may completely differ from duties for another day. To obtain both cost efficient and similar duties, we solve the scheduling problems of different days together.\r\nThe generated duties are then assigned to drivers in the CRP. The CRP is mostly solved sequentially due to its high complexity, namely firstly the rota scheduling problem, and secondly the duty sequencing problem.

In this paper our goal is to improve the battery life property, which is greatly affected by the method of use. We decided to focus on the effects of the discharge current. Each battery is a pack of cells designed to be discharged and charged with specific optimal currents, whereby other currents, i.e. higher or lower than the optimal currents, may have negative effects on the life of the battery. We refer to these negative effects as penalties that are aggregate over time and propose a discharge method to minimize them. The common discharge method is very simple but far from optimal. In this method the energy demand is supplied using all cells in the battery simultaneously, so the load is equally divided among them. Since discharge power demands are not constant, there is room for improvement. The method we propose is an advanced switching algorithm, which for each energy demand selects the battery's cells and controls the discharge current from each, based on understanding the electrochemical properties of the individual cells. We evaluated our proposed switching algorithm using simulations on several battery pack configurations, i.e. number of cells, and power demands. The power demands we employed are based on standard driving cycles used in the United States, Europe and Japan for diversified driving behavior including urban, highway, aggressive and low speed city driving.

We consider two sourcing options: the spot market and a capacity reservation contract. The capacity reservation contract is used as an operational risk hedging for high spot market price incidents. Typically, it needs to be fixed for a longer time horizon specifying the price and quantity and pay the reservation price up front. A combined procurement strategy then has to protect against risks of insufficient demand fulfillment and exploit the benefits of forward buying in periods with low spot price levels. After introducing the problem and a basic quantitative model, we evaluate optimal strategies using different combinations of the above two options. In a comprehensive numerical study using a full factorial design we provide answers to the following questions:\r\n- What advantage can be drawn from dual sourcing compared to strategies with using (a) the spot market and (b) a long-term contract only?\r\n- How does the sourcing strategy react on parameter changes and on capacity for stock-keeping?\r\n- How large is the cost penalty of using a simple base stock policy for dual sourcing and which parameters have a large impact on it?", :title "Single vs. dual sourcing: the strategic impact of stock-keeping on supply strategies", :keyword2 75, :authors (17039 2801 2238), :session 223}, 663 {:keyword1 96, :keyword3 44, :abstract "We address the weighted earliness and tardiness parallel machine scheduling problem (WETP) where jobs have different processing times and distinct due dates.

Decentralization makes the problem partitioned into a number of simpler components which are delegated the process of distributed solution construction. The components, which are agents, are endowed with a state, decision rules, and goals. Each agent employs the most appropriate paradigm for solving its own problem: at every time epoch, it assesses the potential of available actions and uses one that optimizes its reward. Striving to achieve its goal, each agent contributes to the improvement of the overall objective function and influences the final result. Thus, the activities of the agents define the solution process’ dynamics.\r\nWe develop a multi-agent system (MAS), apply it to WETP, investigate its performance, and highlight its advantages.

In the simple newsvendor problem, there are two firms, a supplier and a retailer. Only at the initial period, the retailer chooses an order quantity or a supply contract such as the wholesale-price contract or the option contract. If the retailer rejects the contract, a game between two firms ends and each firm earns a default payoff or implements a noncoordinating contract. However, coordination chance between two firms is not only at the initial period. Though the retailer rejects the contract at the initial period, the retailer has the chance to renegotiate contract terms with the supplier later. It is nothing else but a real option for the retailer. The supplier also has an option modifying contract terms. Therefore, this game can be seized as a real option game with demand uncertainty. Postponement of the retailer’s contract acceptance leads to the opportunity cost for the retailer, but chance to accept better contract or reduction of excess stock. Therefore there is a tradeoff between acceptance or not, and the optimal contract timing for the retailer. As well as the retailer, there is the optimal contract term for the supplier.\r\nI verify occurrence of Pareto improvements from the noncoordinating contract by using various contracts.

This additional demand, especially when it remains unmanaged, may even lead to an increase in fluctuations. To balance demand, price incentives and direct control of devices – known as demand side management (DMS) – may be deployed by utilities.\r\nAgainst this background, the aim of this paper is to present a model of household energy demand under consideration of demand side management. The model considers both, a structural as well as a behavioral level.\r\nOn the structural level, energy usage and flows are modeled as a mathematical network flow problem. The model allows for usage of provided energy (electricity, gas) in order to cover energy demand of private households (devices for lighting, heating, cooling, E-mobility). Energy can be converted (e.g. by CHP) or stored (battery, heat). Energy demand of certain devices can also be reduced or shifted. The behavioral level is represented as an agent-based simulation, where utilities as well as (heterogeneous) consumers are modeled as interacting agents. While the utilities send prices and signals for direct control of devices, the households respond with their energy demand. Thereby, households can react to price changes by adjusting their energy demand patterns (reduction, shifting) based on their objective function and the incentives given.\r\nThis paper is structured as follows: First, a brief motivation is given.

One of the massive land transportation is a train. Maglev train has been a promising choise in train velocity parameters. But the high train velocity appear a stabilization problem. The principal stabilization parameter  is levitation height. This parameter is determined by magnetic force generated by induction current occured in a conductor track. But the induction current is influenced by a track condition. Defect on track can decrease the magnitude of induction current. Thus, testing and evaluation of track condition are a very important issue. For instance, defect identification is one of procedure for evaluating the reliability of a track system. Detection of a defect is the first step that should be performed in testing and evaluation procedures. This procedure is an integral part of quality control and maintenance policy and management.\r\nUntil recently, some defect identification techniques are already developed in many researches. Most of them concentrate to identify a physically  regular shape defect. Moreover, many identification techniques are performed by observing the object visually or by capturing the image of object by a camera. These techniques, generally, identify the defects based on the geometrical shape. But in some cases, the change of electrical conductivity of track can occure without physically defect. Thus, a method for the identification of a physical parameter of defect is need to developt.\r\nIn this paper, a method for  identification of non-conductive section of maglev train track is proposed. Non-conductive section is identified as a physical parameter and the identification is performed in a magnetic field. The magnetic field is generated by flowing the electrical current on the metal track. The current pattern occured in the metal is influenced by the composition of defect. Thus, the defect can be identified by observing and recognizing the magnetic field distribution.  \r\nThis distribution is uniquely produced by current distribution. Thus magnetic field  is used as an observation variable.\r\nIn the previous works, artificial neural networks (ANNs) has shown its ability to recognize a pattern of magnetic field distribution based on current distribution. Furthermore, ANNs has well performed to solve some of inverse problem. Therefore, we will try to use ANNs for recognizing a magnetic field distribution based on composition of non-conductive section directly. \r\nIn this study, we will use a square segmentation to approach  irregular shapes of non-conductive section.

The magnetic field  that relevant to the  non-conductive  section,  will be calculated  in order to obtain  a pair of data pattern.

Flexible products allow the selling firm to assign the purchaser to one of several predefined execution modes at a later point in time. Therefore, flexible products allow supply-side substitution between resources. Examples include applications in passenger air transport, where customers may be notified of their specific itinerary or travel time only shortly before the start of their journey. \r\nAs several authors have shown, flexible products can easily be incorporated into the traditional deterministic linear program (DLP) which is widely used in practice in order to perform capacity control. However, due to the static nature of the DLP, the fact that flexible products may be reallocated to every possible execution mode at any point in time after acceptance cannot appropriately be captured. The decision is only made based on the immediate revenue, which is mostly lower than that of regular products. Thus, the existing approaches underestimate the “value of flexibility”.\r\nIn this talk, we first give an illustrative example demonstrating that the extensions of the DLP proposed so far do not take into consideration the full potential of flexible products. Based on this observation, we formally derive and investigate the “value of flexibility”. We then propose a new DLP-based approach based on the idea to artificially increase the value of flexibility by increasing the revenue of flexible products within the linear approximations, leading to additional acceptance decisions. In order to determine the adjusted revenues, we use a simulation-based optimization method. Numerical examples show the potential benefits of the new approach in terms of achieved revenue.

Traditionally, a product is fully specified by its resource-fare class combination. However, it has been observed that additional demand segments can be addressed through the sale of flexible products which enable airlines to allocate an accepted booking to a pre-defined set of resources. Here, analysis of optimal booking policies is not straightforward since flexible capacity control models with substitutable resources can, in general, not be reduced to multiple traditional models.\r\n\r\nExisting revenue management literature provides structural results for dynamic revenue management models with two resources and multiple fare classes, where accepted flexible customer requests are assumed to be assigned at the instant of their occurrence. Particularly, due to the propagation of certain structural properties of the value functions, switching-curves have been proved to be a proper means of optimal booking control in this setting. Our first result allows to derive a complete characterization of switching-curves in dynamic revenue management models with less effort using the concept of multimodularity. Moreover, we are able to extend the above result of switching control optimality to a static capacity control model with two resources and multiple fares.

Main decision variables are deciding: 1) which thermal generators must be committed in each period of the planning horizon, as well as their production level; and 2) the discharge rates of each hydro generator. The problem is proven to be NP-hard and no exact methods have been able to efficiently solve it, for problem sizes of practical relevance.  Therefore, heuristic and metaheuristic techniques have been used to solve them. In this work we explore two algorithms that hybridize MIP solvers with metaheuristics concepts: the so called “Local Branching” (LB) and a hybridization of “Particle Swarm Optimization” (PSO) with a general purpose MIP solver. In both cases the methods are supported by an iterative piecewise linear approximation that for the thermal Unit Commitment has proven to converge to optimality, even for large problems. In this approach the quadratic cost of thermal generators is approximated by a piecewise linear function that is adjusted iteratively as the main optimization problem is solved. The following thermal constraints are included in the model: ramps, minimum up and down times and production limits.

A large potential for energy efficiency improvement lies in the provision of space heating and domestic hot water in the residential sector. For the assessment of different energy demand and supply options to achieve these objectives, an optimizing energy system model in the TIMES model environment is presented. In the developed model, the integrated analysis of the electricity and heat system allows the investigation of the economic potential of technologies at the interface of both systems over a planning horizon up to 2050, in particular decentralized combined heat and power (CHP) technologies and heat pumps in residential buildings. The coupling of the residential heat system and the electricity system into one model represents a significant methodological development over existing electricity or heat system models. The model is based on linear programming and belongs to the class of integrated power plant capacity and dispatch planning. One common problem with this class of models is the so-called bang-bang behaviour, in which for example small modifications to the constraints result in very different optima, whereby just one technology is exploited across the board. This clearly does not reflect the reality in which technology combinations out of CHP, solar thermal, photovoltaics and heat pumps etc. are often adopted. Hence this paper presents a methodology for implementing case-specific constraints between the decision variables of power plant investment within the standard equation set embedded in TIMES.

The most important characteristics of ambulance systems is that the ambulance could not be necessarily dispatched from the closest station to the patient who make the emergency call if the ambulances in the closest station are all in use. We utilize the vector assignment p-median problem (VAPMP, Weaver and Church 1985) to implement the characteristic in our model. In the model, each demand has a vector of assignments in which the k-th element of the vector is the amount of assignments to the k-th closest facility. We need to estimate the relative frequency of the assignment of demands to the k-th closest facility. However, it is not straightforward, because the relative frequency depends on the location of ambulances. When we solve the model using an estimated relative frequency, the number of assigned demands of each location of ambulances could be changed, and as the result, the relative frequency could also be changed. So we need to resort to an iterative method. Our method iterates the following two steps: the first step is to solve the VAPMP under a given relative frequency and the second step is to simulate the ambulance system using the Markov chain model to reestimate the relative frequency.

The aim is to reduce manufacturing costs to targeted levels. According to the “Functional Method”, as introduced by TANAKA 1989, the target costs are allocated according to the importance of the product's functions. The target costs for the components and parts of a product are derived (indirectly) from the customers' willingness to pay. In the present paper, we question whether the assumption of the functional method concerning the optimal cost structure of the product, i.e. a value ratio of one, is justified. It is shown, that from a production-theoretical perspective, this basic assumption is, in general, not tenable. Nevertheless, it is shown that the functional method has several advantages as a method for incentivizing engineers. Therefore, we propose a \"Modified Functional Method\", which starts with an existing prototype model and where improvements of the functionality should only be carried out, if the additional associated benefit is at least as big as the incremental cost.

This paper focuses on strategic planning of technical capacities in batch production with a wide range of products, and how to join the often conflicting objectives of cost efficiency and energy efficiency. The question to be answered is how are these objectives optimized in the strategic planning stage. In particular, in batch production it must be decided where to produce if there is a multitude of possible routings through a pool of machines which are all allocated by a wide range of products.\r\nTo answer this question, in the first part of the paper a graphical, intuitive way is outlined how to model complex routings in batch production and how to transform this graphical model to a purely mathematical one. The graphical model is defined by the production planner. It is minimal by its set of symbols and at the same time capable of mastering the complexity. After the transformation, the mathematical model can be optimized instantly using a standard linear program solver. The innovative nature of this approach, in use at Bosch Rexroth, lies in its set of algorithms to perform this transformation.\r\nIn the second part of the paper, the effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by optimizing cost efficiency and energy efficiency. Examples show that depending on the volume of products, these objectives may be conflictive or conform. In the conflictive case, an economic decision must be made. But in the conform case, it is immediately clear how to plan the flow of products along all possible routings. Therefore, just by showing if cost efficiency and energy efficiency are conflictive or conform for expected volumes, the decision where to produce is supported considerably.", :title "Optimizing cost efficiency and energy efficiency in batch production for strategic planning", :keyword2 100, :authors (26334 26486), :session 261}, 833 {:keyword1 18, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Offshore wind energy has developed rapidly in the last twenty years.

Under such networks, economies of scale and scope can be realized by consolidating freight through one or more hubs. Since handling processes at hub locations are especially difficult for large-sized and non-standardized products, the number of intermediate hubs on a shipping path is usually limited to no more than two. Furthermore, routing all freight through a hub is not necessarily appropriate in any situations. Direct transports of products are of considerable importance if vehicles are fully loaded and contain products for only a few destinations. As a rule, timber-trade companies receive periodic orders. Hence, they benefit from stable resources planning as well as pick-up and delivery schedules along fixed vehicle routes. In order to yield an efficient transport network for timber-trade companies three critical design questions have to be taken into account: (a) How many hub facilities are required and where should they be positioned? (b) Should node-to-node links be directly connected or via one or two hubs? (c) Can nodes be combined to form vehicle routes, where every route starts and ends at an assigned hub? The overall network operating costs are composed of fixed costs for establishing hub facilities, and variable costs for handling and transporting goods (directly or on routes).

Due to the significant variant variety in the production program and the implemented standardization of parts, production planning has to cope with considerable differences in sequence-dependent setup times. Therefore, lot sizing decisions may have significant impact on the overall efficiency of the production process. In order to increase flexibility, job due dates are integrated as soft time restrictions with individual tardiness costs. Consequently, the real-world problem is modeled as a dynamic capacitated lot-sizing problem with linkage, sequence dependency and backorders (CLSPL-SDBO). Dynamism in the considered problem results from various sources. For instance, production planning has to deal with dynamic incoming new requests as well as with machine breakdowns, short-term due date modifications of the customer demands and delayed material deliveries.

Specifically, infeasible production plans are quickly repaired by simple priority rules in order to allow an instant feasible continuation of the process execution. Afterwards, a continuous optimization of the adapted plan is performed using a fast Tabu Search heuristic with an efficient shifting scheme.

Since more than 95% of the worldwide produced steel is continuous casted, slab production at continuous casters is the central process in the steel industry. The determination of a sequence to produce slabs requires solving a combined lot sizing and scheduling problem, which can be formulated as MILP (see Wichmann et al., 2012). This MILP is unique in terms of four specific requirements which comprise flexible job specifications, continuously adjustable in-situ control parameters, material supply in batches and different types of machine setups. To solve the MILP, we propose a genetic algorithm, incorporating crossover, mutation and selection operators. The most special feature of the approach is the handling of the problems’ characteristics in each of the operators. Thus, crossover as well as mutation operators take the material supply in batches into account. The selection operators aim to keep diversity within the evolving population. We analyze the performance of the approach in a numerical case study with known numerous data sets generated from real world data. To evaluate the performance, we compare the solutions to a given lower bound as well as reference solution procedures.

An interesting application of resource leveling that substantiates the total adjustment costs occurs if the resources represent different kinds of manpower and the people must be brought to their workplaces using expensive means of transportation, e.g. airplanes, helicopters or boats. \r\nFirst, we discuss structural properties of the problem. In contrast to the classical resource leveling objective function, the total adjustment cost function is not r-monotone which leads to relatively weak lower linear programming bounds. Furthermore, positive jumps in the resource requirements can only occur at points in time at which at least one real activity is started. This property is used in an entirely new MIP formulation. Altogether, we present three different mixed-integer linear programming formulations.

The problem is to find a good assignment of students to school classes taking into account additional sideconstraints. These constraints were developed together with the administration of an elementary school in order to meet their requirements in such an assignment. A problem formulation as an integer linear program is presented, the transportation problem being a relaxation of this linear program. The Lagrangian relaxation is approximately solved with subgradient optimization. In each step, the Lagrangian heuristic provides feasible solutions and the subproblem, a transportation problem, has to be solved. This is done efficiently by a primal network simplex method. The performance of the solution of the subproblems is important for the total runtime. Thus, the network simplex method is presented and analyzed and additionally extensive computational results with regard to different strategies and arguments are presented. The Lagrangian heuristic (together with subgradient optimization) is able to find good feasible solutions, but mostly not optimal solutions. Hence, a branch and bound algorithm is presented to find optimal solutions. The corresponding lower bounds are\r\nprovided by the subgradient optimization and equal those of an LP  relaxation.

In a real world transport auction, the procurement volume can sum up to several million dollars. Transport auctions exhibit two specific features: On the one hand, there are economies of scope between the tendered transport contracts. For a given carrier, the costs of executing a transport contract depend on the other contracts the carrier wins (e.g. whether they are well combinable in a single tour). On the other hand, shippers usually trade off cost savings for an increase in transport quality. Transport quality is affected by the way carriers cope with heterogeneous transport requirements which may arise from characteristics of the goods to be transported (e.g. fragile, hazardous) or from different customer needs (e.g. time windows).\r\nIn the transportation procurement literature, approaches considering both economies of scope and transport quality are missing mostly. To close this gap to some extent, we focus on the winner determination problem. This problem has to be solved by a shipper after all carriers have submitted their bids; the task is to decide which bids should be accepted as winning bids. The proposed model extends the well-known set covering problem and has two objective functions (minimize transport costs, maximize transport quality). In order to solve the model, Pareto optimizers based on branch-and-bound and metaheuristic-hybrids have been developed and evaluated. All procedures compute a set of non-dominated solutions.

I‘ll describe my work in this area, using a combination of statistics to model inputs, approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to make stationing decisions in real time, simulation optimization to \"tune\" the ADP algorithm and bounding techniques to determine what response times might be achievable in a given city.

Network flows over time include a temporal dimension and therefore provide a more realistic modeling tool than classical \"static\" network flow models. While flows over time have already been introduced by Ford and Fulkerson in the 1950s, several more sophisticated models have been studied later on. After giving a general introduction to network flows over time, we are going to present recent work in this area.
