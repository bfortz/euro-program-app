In such a case, the operator needs to adjust the schedule in order to get back to the original schedules. Because a train operator may have the policy of economically compensating  passengers when they incur in delays,  it is important to have a way of deciding whether to speed up trains in order to absorb delays or to compensate passengers. In this paper a mathematical model which decides on the speed profile while considering passenger use is presented. The model decides on the optimal sequence of operating regimes and the switching points between them for a range of different circumstances and train types all while considering delays, passenger compensation policies, track specific constraints and train conflicts. The objective of this paper is to minimize both energy consumed and incurred compensation to passengers.

Note that the same operation may appear multiple times as part of the same sequence of operations. The problem consists of allocating the node processing and arc bandwidth resources such that set of commodities (service chains) can be handled at minimum cost by the deployed functions at each node. The goal is thus to jointly select the subset of nodes where to place operators and find a demand assignment (without exceeding both node processing and arc capacity) that minimizes the sum of location, supplying/running and transportation/routing costs. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming formulation which combines a variant of the multi-product capacitated location (with precedence constraints to account for the operation order in the sequence) together with the fixed-charge multicommodity flow problem; thus, as a variant of the location-routing model. Next, in order to cope with demand variations over time (e.g., size and operation sequence), we extend our formulation to multiperiod problems. This so-called dynamic location-routing model aims at enabling adjustment of operators’ placement and routing decisions at minimum reorganization cost, e.g., by limiting the number of changes in running demands. Note that accounting for operator relocation cost yields a quadratic formulation. Then, we propose computational methods and evaluate their performance over representative scenarios and compare the results with those obtained when solving both placement and routing problems independently.", :title "Mixed-Integer Programming Model for the Joint Placement and Routing of Function Sequences", :keyword2 23, :authors (32497), :session 397846}, 46 {:keyword1 157, :keyword3 98, :abstract "“Interior point algorithms are a good choice for solving pure LPs or QPs, but when you solve MIPs, all you need is a dual simplex.” This is the common conception which disregards that an interior point solution provides some unique structural insight into the problem at hand.

The TSPFN is an extension of the Euclidean TSP in the plane where direct connections between points that have distance two or less are forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe TSPFN is motivated by an application in laser beam melting. In the production of a workpiece in several layers it is possible to reduce the internal stress of the workpieces by not allowing the consecutive heating of points that are close to each other. The points in this application are typically arranged on grids that are nearly regular. Hence in this presentation we examine the TSPFN on a regular grid that can also be interpreted as a chessboard with respective dimensions. \r\n\r\nFor the TSPFN with a radius of length two direct connections between points that have distance greater than two are allowed. This means that feasible steps of minimal length between two points on regular grids are knight's moves. Hence if a knight’s tour can be constructed on a certain chessboard, this knight’s tour is a feasible and optimal solution for the TSPFN with a radius of length two on the respective regular grid.\r\n\r\nWe connect the existing algorithms for the knight's tour problem with newly developed methods to solve the TSPFN with a radius of length two on grids with arbitrary dimensions. In most cases our methods are based on the construction schemes used for solving knight's tour problem, i.e. we connect special tours on grids with small dimensions to generate optimal TSPFN tours on grids with arbitrary dimensions.

In particular, for closed online TSP, we provide a 1.64-competitive algorithm, thus matching a known lower bound. For open online TSP, we give a new upper bound as well as a matching lower bound that establish the remarkable competitive ratio of 2.04.\r\nAdditionally, we consider the online Dial-A-Ride problem on the line, where each request needs to be transported to a specified destination. We provide an improved non-preemptive lower bound of 1.75 for this setting, as well as an improved preemptive algorithm with competitive ratio 2.41.\r\nFinally, we generalize known and give new complexity results for the underlying offline problems. In particular, we give an algorithm with running time O(n^2) for closed offline TSP on the line with release dates and show that both variants of offine Dial-A-Ride on the line are NP-hard for any capacity c>=2 of the server.", :title "Tight Competitive Analysis for Online TSP on the Line", :keyword2 0, :authors (49270 45087 50585 45219 52563 45132 55406 55408 55409), :session 397897}, 119 {:keyword1 74, :keyword3 41, :abstract "Portfolio parallelization is an approach that runs multiple algorithms or solver configurations in parallel and terminates when one of them succeeds in solving the problem.

Brand personality – human characteristics associated to a brand – is known as a central diver for affective brand loyalty. Recent studies already revealed, that consumers prefer those brands, which are in line with their own personality traits. Because brand personality is created by organization’s communication mix, organizations may therefore explore the personality traits of their target market segments and attach the corresponding personality to their brand. However, focusing on consumers' personality traits for market segmentation is challenging, since personality traits are not directly observable. Hence, linking personality traits to variables, which are easily observable, may reduce organization’s communication effort. \r\nWithin our study, we explore the personality traits of sportsmen from several sport clusters, e.g., sport players, sport fighters etc. To measure sportsmen’s personality, we used the popular Big Five approach, which describes personality by five factors, i.e., extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, consciousness and openness. We found evidence that the considered sport clusters significantly differ within certain personality traits. E.g., nature sportsmen turned out to be most extravert and open, while fitness sportsmen are most conscious. Hence, consumer’s choice of a specific kind of sport may be used as a predictor for his/her response to brand personality, i.e., affective brand loyalty.

That is, the approximation guarantee can be bounded in terms of properties of the inequality system, such as supermodularity of the right hand side.\r\nWe investigate similar structural properties in the weighted case.

The spot price charged to the customers is then set to the marginal production cost.\r\nFampa et al. have considered the problem faced by a profit- maximizing producer, whose bids depend on the behaviour of the system opera- tor, as well as the stochastic nature of final demand, and that can be cast within the framework of stochastic bilevel programming.\r\nIn this presentation, we consider an enhanced model that embeds two key fea- tures, namely the uncertainty related to competitors’ bids, as well as the impact of spot prices on demand. Our aim is to develop efficient solution algorithms for addressing instances involving a large number of scenarios.\r\nUnder the assumptions that production costs are linear and that demand is piecewise constant, the bilevel model can be reformulated as a large mixed integer program. Although this problem becomes numerically intractable as the number of scenarios increases, it becomes much simpler when producers are allowed to place different price-quantity bids for a given generator. This relaxation of the original problem can than be solved in polynomial time by a dynamic program- ming algorithm. This algorithm can then be adapted to heuristically solve the original problem, yielding very quickly feasible solutions characterized by small optimality gaps. The performance of the method has been tested on instances inspired from the Brazilian Electric System National Operator.\r\n", :title "Dynamic programming approach for bidding problems on day-ahead markets", :keyword2 156, :authors (55546 5426 55564 2521 6663), :session 1101541}, 171 {:keyword1 154, :keyword3 42, :abstract "A bipartite graph G between n clients and n servers is revealed online.

Our goals in this model are twofold. First, we want to minimize the number of times clients are reallocated between the servers.

Additionally, demand for the product fluctuates due to varying state of the world conditions evolving according to a finite-state Markov chain. Units are produced ahead of demand, with exponentially distributed times. Sales revenue is collected upon fulfillment of demand. If orders cannot be fulfilled immediately, they are either backordered, in the case of the long-term market, or lost, in the case of the walk-in market.

In this set-up, a principal seeks to uncover and remedy an issue that occurs to an agent at a random point in time, and which harms the principal if not addressed promptly. This occurrence is the agent’s private information. Further, the agent can exert effort to render the principal’s audits ineffective at discovering the issue. We fully characterize, in closed form, the corresponding optimal policy, which can be implemented as a dynamic remediation cost-sharing mechanism with cyclic audits. We show that the strength of the agent’s evasion capability changes the nature of the audit policy. When the effort cost is high (i.e., the evasion capability is weak), the principal runs the audit according to a pre-determined schedule. However, when the effort cost is low (i.e. the evasion capability is strong), the audit schedule becomes random.

Sequential posted price mechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted price mechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands only one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the buyers. \r\n\r\nFor standard sequential posted price mechanisms, we prove that with the valuation distribution having finite support, no sequential posted price mechanism can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even with unlimited supply. We extend this result to the case of a continuous valuation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously (i.e., everywhere-supported, continuous, symmetric, and normalized (conditional) distributions that satisfy regularity, the MHR condition, and affiliation). In fact, it turns out that the best fraction of the optimal revenue that is extractable by a sequential posted price mechanism is proportional to the ratio of the highest and lowest possible valuation. \r\n\r\nWe prove that a simple generalization of these mechanisms achieves a better revenue performance; namely, if the sequential posted price mechanism has for each buyer the option of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then a fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted that is inversely proportional to the \"degree of interdependence\" d in the valuation distribution.

Empirical studies regularly reveal that a simple averaging (SA) over a group of forecasts outperforms the best individual forecast.

The latter finding is due to the instability of learned weights that are sensitive to randomness in limited training data. The weighting scheme most sensitive to training data is the least squares solution that determines so-called optimal weights (OW). Some work has been published that show that a linear combination of OW and SA, i.e., the proportional shrinkage of OW towards SA, can beneficially trade--off the high bias of SA and the high sampling-based variance of OW and improve the accuracy achieved with either one of the individual weighting schemes. We propose the non-linear shrinkage of OW towards SA by penalizing the absolute sum of weight deviations from equal weights using the Generalized Lasso.

We provide the following results. First, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of all problem parameters, for the existence of a unique interior solution in the zero replenishment lead time case and characterize the optimal solution. Second, based on the parametric fractional programming, we propose a solution method to solve the problem to the optimality under the assumption of exponentially distributed replenishment lead time.

In peak situations the gate and yard areas at container terminals are often strained to deal with the high amount of arriving trucks causing high costs for the terminals and long waiting times for the trucks. One much discussed method to mitigate the strain caused by peaks is to introduce a truck appointment system. The effects of this system on terminal performance and on truck waiting times have been analyzed widely in past studies with varying results.

Following the approach of Bader, Hildebrand, Weismantel, and Zenkusen (2016), we show how to reformulate the integer programming (IP) formulations of the two-stage bipartite b-matching problems as MIPs that only use few integer variables. To preserve integrality, an appropriate affine TU decomposition of the constraint matrix needs to be found. In the case of the two-stage bipartite b-matching problem with only one knapsack constraint, we present an affine TU decomposition and show that in a specific MIP reformulation the number of integral variables only depends on the number of nodes in one shore of the graph. For the two-stage bipartite b-matching problem with several knapsack constraints, an appropriate affine TU decomposition cannot be derived in a straight forward way. However, we present a similar decomposition of the constraint matrix and prove that this decomposition preserves integrality and thus allows a MIP reformulation with less integer variables. Applications of such robust two-stage bipartite b-matching problems are in robust runway scheduling in air traffic management. Each aircraft is assigned a time slot at the first stage before the uncertainty reveals. If an disturbed scenario occurs the plan might become infeasible and the aircraft need to be replanned in the second stage.

We consider a real-time on-demand feeder service supported by one operator. The operator uses a fleet of homogeneous capacitated vehicles and designs its routing and dispatching policy.

Firstly, we compute which requests can be pairwise combined and which vehicles can serve the requests by satisfying the constraints in terms of passengers’ maximum waiting time, maximum delay and vehicles’ capacity. We combine possible pre-/post- transit trip requests as groups based on the pairwise request-vehicle graph. Then we compute which feasible trips (a set of requests) can be served by which vehicles. Finally, optimal trip-vehicle assignment is determined by solving an integer linear program problem. Efficient rebalancing strategy for idle vehicles is proposed to reduce users’ waiting times. The numerical study is conducted on a realistic bi-modal transportation network located in Luxembourg and cross-border area.

However, in practice it is often required that the routes are visually attractive as those are more likely to be accepted by the decision makers. The visual attractiveness of a solution can be measured among others by its compactness. Second, for each used vehicle fixed costs arise. Since compact routes can be easily achieved by deploying many vehicles, a trade-off emerges between maximizing the compactness and minimizing the number of vehicles.

Therefore, in this paper, we develop a problem of dynamic pricing and lot-sizing where demand and deterioration are exposed to randomness. This stochastic model is based on Markov decision theory. We assume that the inter-arrival times follow an Erlang distribution. We find the optimal dynamic price policy by using the value-iteration algorithm and in an outer loop we find the optimal lot-size. We assume that at any time an arriving customer has a reservation price that is perceived by the retailer to be a random variable and the customer only will demand a unit if his reservation price is larger than or equal to the announced price. For the special case with Exponential distributed inter-arrival times, we demonstrate how to do the joint optimization (pricing and lot-sizing) using the policy-iteration algorithm. These models are developed under the assumption that the replenishment lead-time is zero. Next, we extend our model also to assume Erlangean distributed lead-times and we find the optimal price policy by using the value-iteration algorithm and in two outer loops we find the optimal lot-size and re-order point. In addition to our model developments, we also do some numerical investigations. For the case of zero lead-time we investigate whether the lot-sizing and pricing decisions can be decomposed.

Herein, low technology level refers to lower fixed facility costs but higher carbon-dioxide emission levels at plants. Contrarily, high technology refers to higher fixed facility costs but lower environmental costs at plants. By the means of green transportation, the proposed model makes a trade-off between transportation cost and carbon-dioxide emission cost. We consider that all the transportation in the network is outsourced from a logistics firm where three different types of vehicles are used for transportation. Load ranges that can be transported with each of these vehicle types are pre-determined. Transportation costs can be reduced by choosing large-sized trucks but it causes to negative environmental effects when it compares to small-sized trucks.

To account for the multi-level hierarchal structure of sales organizations, this allocation planning is often not performed by means of a (centralized) optimization-based approach, but through “simple” allocation rules (i.e. “per commit” and “rank based”) that can be applied decentrally and iteratively (top-down) on each level of the hierarchy. In a setting in which a planner wants to achieve customer-specific service-level targets under stochastic demand, these rules oftentimes lead to significant miss-allocations and detrimental performance.  \r\nBased on a rigorous analysis of optimal allocation techniques we derive two new allocation rules, called the “hybrid” and the “service-level aggregation” approach, that can reduce the gap to an optimal allocation significantly.

In fact, with two new measures(termed as “within” and “between” heterogeneity), we categorize hierarchies and predict the performance of the “advanced” allocation rules with sufficient accuracy. As the rules lead to good allocations in opposing hierarchy configurations, the “within” and “between” heterogeneity of the hierarchy helps the planner to decide which of the advanced rules should be used or if a “simple” conventional approach is sufficient.

First, an initial solution is constructed using a cheapest insertion methodology followed by a local search to avoid single-customer-routes and to balance initial inventory levels. We then apply ALNS to the obtained solution. We developed several destroy and repair operators that target certain aspects of the specific problem in order to obtain good routing and inventory plans. These operators not only deal with distance and inventory costs but, moreover, with inconsistency in the arrival times to the customers. Finally, we present computational results obtained by applying our exact method as well as the proposed metaheuristic to a benchmark set of artificial instances and a set of instances based on real world consumption data.

In such problems, we are given a finite set of commodities that request certain sets of resources, e.g., paths in a network. The cost of each resource grows superlinearly with the demand for it, and our goal is to minimize the total cost of the resources. A natural distributed approach to solve these problems are local dynamics where in each step a single commodity switches its allocated resources whenever the new solution after the switch has smaller total cost over all commodities. These dynamics converge to a local optimal solution, and we are interested in quantifying the locality gap, i.e., the worst case ratio of the cost of a local optimal solution and a global optimal solution. We derive tight bounds on the locality gap both for weighted and unweighted commodities. By sacrificing an additional small factor, these locality gaps yield deterministic and combinatorial polynomial time algorithms that can be implemented in a distributed manner and provably approximate the optimal solution with approximation guarantee depending on the cost functions on the resources.

Increasing urbanization brings with it various environmental problems such as global warming, energy consumption, increasing housing density, exporting wastes, and greenhouse gasses. The importance of green city assessments has become popular for scholars and researchers in many fields. Therefore, cities should be evaluated in terms of various criteria in order to increase the quality of life and sustainability of the environment. The existence of these criteria in the assessment of green cities reveals the need for multi-criteria decision-making tools.This paper proposes a hybrid approach based on fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for evaluation of green cities regarding selected criteria such as biodiversity and ecosystem, infrastructure and transportation, use of forestry, agriculture, energy alternatives, and buildings. Fuzzy AHP method is applied to obtain the weight of criteria according to different decision makers’ judgments. Decision makers consist of city planners, academicians and experts from municipalities and Turkish ministry of environment and urbanization. Then, TOPSIS method is applied for ranking cities by using the weights obtained from fuzzy AHP method.

In each search node the earliest time-feasible schedule is determined by a modified label correcting algorithm where each activity is restricted to certain time points.

Most heavily hit were banks with a notable exposure to ship finance, who saw the collateral value of many loans being diminished. Industry observers trace back the rare occurrence of actual defaults of ship loans to the use of the Long-Term-Asset Value (LTAV), a valuation method explicitly designed for ship investments. As the LTAV is based on a discounted cash-flow approach, it accounts for investment risks in the discount rate. Consequently, the LTAV bundles the time value of money and risk in a single value, which begs the question if this method oversimplifies the incorporation of risk in the evaluation of ship investments. In the context of infrastructure investments, the Decoupled Net Present Value (DNPV) has recently been proposed as an alternative method that addresses the problem of using risk-adjusted discount rates. It separates the time value of money from risks by quantifying risk factors individually and treating them as costs to the investment. We provide a proof-of-concept regarding the applicability of the DNPV in the context of ship investments. To this end, we develop a DNPV valuation model and instantiate a prototype in Python.

The solution of such linear systems is the most expensive step of these methods.

In particular, for interior point methods, the linear system becomes highly ill-conditioned as an optimal solution is approached. The splitting preconditioner is very effective when applied together with the conjugate gradient method, in the final iterations, for the linear systems arising from interior point methods. These preconditioners rely on an LU factorization of an a priori unknown linearly independent subset of the linear problem constraint matrix columns. However, that preconditioner is expensive to compute since a non-singular matrix must be built from such set of linearly independent columns. In this work, a new version of the splitting preconditioner is presented dropping the need to obtain a non-singular matrix. The controlled Cholesky factorization is used to compute the preconditioner from the normal equations matrix from a given set of not necessarily independent columns. Such an approach is practicable since the controlled Cholesky factorization may be computed by adding suitable diagonal perturbations with a polynomial shift strategy.

Unfortunately, even if bidders are not strategic, we cannot always hope for welfare maximization and a competitive equilibrium in a market where buyers have budget constraints. In contrast to classical equilibrium theory, the welfare maximizing allocation might not give rise to a competitive equilibrium and calculating a stable outcome can lead to significant computational complexity as the allocation problem is not independent from the pricing problem anymore.

The answer should not only depend of the delay, but there are other factors to consider, for example capacity restrictions. We present an optimization model for delay management in railway networks that accounts for capacity constraints on the number of passengers that a train can effectively carry. While limited capacities of tracks and stations have been considered in delay management models, passenger train capacity has been neglected in the literature so far, implicitly assuming an infinite train capacity. However, even in open systems where no seat reservation is required and passengers may stand during the journey if all seats are occupied, physical space is naturally limited and the number of standing seats constrained for passenger safety reasons.

Different from other applications of the framework to routing problems, in our case efficient and strong label dominance rules cannot be derived. Nevertheless, by applying the idea of reduced cost bounding we are able to avoid combinatorial explosion and solve exactly the pricing problem.

This can be avoided by moving some assembly steps to pre-levels thus smoothing out the utilization of the main line.

A large number of customers demand a high number of specialized products, which are characterized by shortened product life cycles. As a result, the exact type and location of demands are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Recently, the use of modular plants has received much attention as an answer for these new challenges. Modular plants consist of standardized process modules, which allow for quick assembly, disassembly and relocation of production plants. Depending on the combination of process modules, different production capabilities are associated with a production plant. Further, production plants can be reconfigured by changing one or more process modules, to quickly alter the type of production capacity which is provided by a plant. In consequence, the flexibility of the production network is strongly increased. We analyze novel mixed integer programming formulations for production network planning with and without consideration of short-term plant reconfigurations and capacity shifts.

A well-known behavioral phenomenon related to the inventory of a retailer, but often neglected in inventory management, is the scarcity effect, i.e. the demand for a product increases if the inventory is low. Our research addresses the question of how scarcity behavior impacts the performance of two common classes of inventory policies - periodic and continuous policies. Since the fill rate, i.e. the fraction of demand that is satisfied directly from stock on hand, is the most common way of measuring service, we configure both inventory policies in order to achieve the same target fill rate. To investigate the influence of the scarcity effect on the two policies and vice versa, we set up an experiment with human decision makers acting as buyers. For both policies, we consider a treatment with a high fill rate and a treatment with low fill rate. Our preliminary results indicate that scarcity behavior can already be observed in settings with few buyers and a theoretical stock-out probability close to zero, verifying that it is a strong effect and furthermore, we find that scarcity behavior negatively impacts the performance of both inventory policies.

Consequently, dismantling of aging wind turbines will increase significantly in upcoming years due to repowering or decommissioning of wind farms and lead to millions of costs for operators. An option to supersede the costly and time-consuming dismantling of wind turbines entirely on-site is to establish a dismantling network in which partly dismantled wind turbines are transported to specialized dismantling sites for further handling. This network requires an optimization model to determine optimal locations and an appropriate distribution of disassembly steps to dismantling sites. The challenge is to consider the network’s dependency on the trade-off between transportation and dismantling costs which in turn depends on the selection of dismantling depths and sites.

It is defined as selecting an initial set of k nodes in a social network such that the total number of affected nodes is maximized at the end of the influence spread. In this study, a competitive version of IMP, a Stackelberg game on a social network is considered. The leader of the game tries to maximize its influence spread by selecting a set of influential nodes and the follower tries to minimize the leader's influence by deactivating a subset of the influential nodes. The deactivated nodes cannot affect their neighbors, nor they spread an opposite idea or information. As is the case with all Stackelberg games, it is assumed that the follower has complete knowledge about leader’s decisions. Once the leader and the follower make their decisions, the influence propagates according to the well-known Linear Threshold (LT) diffusion model until no more nodes can be affected. The problem is modeled as a stochastic bi-level integer programming formulation. To deal with the uncertainty in the node threshold parameter of the LT diffusion model used in the lower level problem, a three-stage sample average approximation (SAA) scheme is implemented. To solve the bilevel model, we propose a matheuristic method. Namely, a simulated annealing heuristic is applied to perform search in the solution space of the upper level problem (i.e., the selection of the influential nodes).

Mathematical optimization is increasingly used at clinics for dose planning of the treatment, in which the source irradiation pattern is decided.

Such an index quantifies the discretised portion of the tumour that gets at least (or for organs, at most) the prescribed dose.\r\n\r\nThere are optimization models for dose planning that take homogenity of the dose into account, but there are none, to our knowledge, that also includes the spatial distribution of the received dose. Insufficient spatial distribution of the dose may result in hot spots, which are contiguous volumes in the tumour that receive a dose that is too high (e.g. more than 200% of the prescribed dose). This aspect is a reason of concern because of risk for complications. With a given dose plan that satisfies the targets in terms of dosimetric indices, a common clinical practice is to inspect the spatial dose distribution before approving the dose plan and if the hot spots are too large, adjust the dose plan.\r\n\r\nWe study this adjustment process by means of mathematical optimization and introduce criteria that take spatial distribution of dose into account with the aim to spread out or reduce the size of hot spots.

All the problems are downward monotone, that is restricting the problem to a subgraph yields an instance of the same problem on a smaller graph. We use this fact and define so called exact subgraph constraints. For a certain subgraph the exact subgraph constraint ensures, that the submatrix of the calculation of the relaxation corresponding to the subgraph is in the convex hull of all stable set, max-cut or coloring matrices of the subgraph respectively. \r\nTherefore, in order to get an improved  bound for the above problems, one can start with the original relaxation and include the exact subgraph constraints for many small - wisely chosen - subgraphs. We call a problem of such form P1.\r\nSolving P1 is very time-consuming with off-the-shelf solvers, hence it requires alternative solution methods.\r\nBy building the Lagrangian dual of P1 with respect to the exact subgraph constraints, one gets an optimization problem P2, where the objective function can be split (with common linear variables) into a part which captures the SDP and a second linear part. To P2  a specialized version of the bundle method, namely the bundle method with easy sum components, can be applied in a very natural way. In the resulting iterative solution method, in each iteration one has to solve an SDP with few constraints (for the oracle) and a very nicely structured QP or alternatively a larger LP (for getting the new trial point).\r\nIn the talk we will discuss different solution methods for this QP and see that our method significantly improves the running times to solve P1 to our desired accuracy.", :title "A Modified Bundle Method for SDP with Exact Subgraph Constraints", :keyword2 164, :authors (49285 55485 48955), :session 397842}, 561 {:keyword1 97, :keyword3 127, :abstract "In the past, the aim of minimizing manufacturing costs has dominated the design of supply chains for many companies from the (European) apparel industry, which came along with long-distance shipping from Far East and relatively lengthy production cycles. Today, short throughput times have become another, in some market segments even more important, factor for gaining competitive advantage as flexibility in production allows for adjusting to the rapidly changing fashion trends in these segments. Choosing the 'right' supply chain strategy is well analyzed in literature. However, in an attempt to reduce complexity when modeling the underlying market, recent research limits itself to some selected aspects (e.g., strategic buyers, one period, one product, and one retailer). An agent-based simulation, in contrast, can account for several competing retailers with different supply chain strategies as well as variations of individual consumer preferences over time as a result of word-of-mouth communication and social influence. In our talk, we introduce such a simulation approach. It has been parameterized by means of a conjoint study that provides consumers' preferences for clothes and brands, as well as information on their communication and buying behavior. The possible application of the ABS is illustrated for several supply chain strategies (i.e., fast fashion vs. traditional) with varying communication strategies (e.g., in terms of extent of advertising measures) in several market scenarios (i.e., one market leader vs. few established brands vs. a highly competitive market with many players).", :title "An agent-based simulation for analyzing supply chain strategies in the apparel industry", :keyword2 101, :authors (4357 40853 16912 40852 55876), :session 3060891}, 562 {:keyword1 94, :keyword3 163, :abstract "The idea of min-max-min robustness is to calculate k different solutions of a linear combinatorial problem such that these solutions are worst-case optimal if we consider the respectively best of the calculate solutions in each scenario.

It reflects companies’ ability to differentiate and manage supply chains at a more granular level but still remain economical. Although there does not appear to be a standardised way, approaches in the literature commonly segment supply chains into lean and agile segments by using product specific criteria. The challenges for companies then are threefold: 1) determining the segmentation criteria, 2) transforming the segmentation strategies into operational activities, and 3) quantifying the impact of applying such a segmented strategy on total cost. Compared with the first issue, much less research effort has been made for the second and third issues. However, current studies still provide a conceptual framework for integrating segmented strategies into supply chain design: tactically, by determining the level of centralisation, and operationally, via any methods to shorten lead times and to optimise inventory levels.\r\nIn this paper, we address the second and third issues by proposing an approach to jointly optimise the network configuration and segmentation based on segmentation criteria (e.g. volume and variability of demand). We include safety stock placement as one of the key decisions to assess the impact of uncertainty in differentiating supply chain design. Particularly, we adopt the guaranteed service model to optimise safety stock while considering risk pooling effects. In addition, we consider other tactical aspects such as the consolidation effect in transportation.

VMM is desirable e.g. in case of server maintenance and significant changes in resource demands or if the operational costs of the data centers considerably change (e.g. due to changes in the local energy prices). VMM also requires the rerouting of inter-VM traffic flows. If the migration process must be conducted within a fixed time limit (migration deadline), certain constraints are imposed on the data center network. For instance, before the process is triggered, a minimum capacity needs to be available in the network to perform the migration within the deadline. However, for one-step VMM, due to the limited network resources, solely relying on the residual capacity is not adequate to ensure a feasible migration solution. In this work, we consider a multi-step migration approach and take into account the so-called \"soft bottlenecks\", which refer to capacity bottlenecks caused by the preoccupation of capacity due to existing virtual networks and other migration processes. By taking advantage of the possibilities for releasing and relocating these soft bottlenecks, the hosting capability of the data center infrastructure can be fully explored, and VMM can be made feasible while guaranteeing the fulfillment of the migration deadlines. Our new migration model is based on a mixed integer program (MIP), whose objective is to minimize the required migration steps.

However, surveys among transport planners show that in addition to cost, also criteria such as reliability and safety are important and there is also an ongoing discussion about environmental impacts of transport. Therefore, other alternatives in addition to road should be considered in transport planning.\r\nOne of the alternatives is intermodal transport, combining different transport modes where goods are transported in standardized loading units. Since this transport alternative requires higher coordination between the individual transport services, finding reliable routes before the start of the transport is here even more important than for single-mode transport. Thus, we present a mixed-integer linear programming approach for intermodal transport planning taking into account uncertainty in travel times by using different approaches for increasing the reliability of the plans, in particular a sample average approximation and a simulation-optimization approach. The plans can be optimized according to multiple objectives, such as cost, time and emissions and the results of the different approaches are compared based on a real-world case study.

An application for intelligent microgrids are multi-building districts with local thermal and electrical energy production. Operating such systems is challenging for two reasons. Firstly, thermal and electrical energy demand do not occur simultaneously requiring storages for an efficient operation of coproduction units such as combined heat and power plants. Secondly, renewable production is unsteady and uncertain and does not necessarily follow demand.\r\nThe work at hand investigates a multi-building district equipped with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and a Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS) that participates in energy markets.

For deliveries, the travel time needed to service an order depends on the overall set of accepted orders, so that the effect on capacity cannot be finally determined on individual order request arrival.

This affects not only private cars, but also fright vehicles as well as public transportation, hence buses. A cost-minimal network configuration for electric city buses, including battery ageing effects, is the focus of this presentation.\r\n\r\nElectric city buses with stationary charging technology follow the trend of sustainable technologies and unburden cities from greenhouse gases and noise emissions. However, their technology and charging infrastructure is still costly, and a cost-optimal solution strongly depends on the batteries' capacities as well as on the number and locations of charging stations. The capacity of a battery is again greatly influenced by ageing effects due to time and usage. The objective is to find a set of locations for the charging stations that keeps the overall costs minimal.\r\n\r\nIn our talk we discuss the parameters influencing the battery performance and deduce a capacity decay function to incorporate the impact of battery ageing. We introduce a mixed integer model with multiple periods that gives a cost-optimal solution.

Based on a block structured (stochastic) linear problem, the results regarding the scalability and efficiency of the HPC solution were obtained on two Petaflops supercomputers: Hazel Hen, a Cray XC40-system, at High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS) and JURECA, a fat tree EDR-InfiniBand cluster, at Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC).", :title "High Performance Computing for Energy System Modelling", :keyword2 74, :authors (55769 55923), :session 1101550}, 666 {:keyword1 92, :keyword3 75, :abstract "The recovery of used products has been receiving more attention due to the growing awareness on sustainable production. Remanufacturing is a widely accepted product reuse process in practice, by which, the used products are recovered or updated to as good as new condition. The products are returned to the original equipment manufacturers due to various reasons such as end-of-life, false failure and warranty. The returned products are remanufactured to satisfy customer demands for new products. This study addresses a lot-sizing problem subject to the assumptions of capacitated production and remanufacturing, stochastic demand and returned products, and infinite planning horizon. The aim is to maximize the expected long-term discounted profit by deciding the amount of new products to be produced. The addressed lot-sizing problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process. Dynamic Programming approach allows to obtain optimal solutions for small-sized instances of the problem. However, as the problem size increases, computation and memory requirements render Dynamic Programming approach infeasible. This study proposes an Approximate Dynamic Programming based heuristic algorithm for the problem. Several numerical analyses are conducted to determine the optimal production plans using the DP method and to demonstrate the practical applicability and performance of the ADP-based algorithm.

In this paper, we suggest a model to determine workout strategies given the stylized fact that debtors react differently to weaker and stronger workout actions (e.g. mail contact, phone contact, legal proceedings). Debtors are ceteris paribus more likely to pay when faced with stronger workout actions but stronger workout actions tend to be more costly for the creditor. There is therefore a need to find optimal workout strategies for the creditor. We suggest a regression model in which the creditworthiness of a debtor is a linear combination of debtor characteristics. The reaction towards workout actions is incorporated by using skewed error terms that make payments more likely for strong workout measures and less likely for weak workout measures. We outline, how the model coefficients and skewness parameters can be estimated from empirical data. \r\nUsing simulated data, we show that model predictions can be substantially improved using our model to account for the debtor’s behaviour when compared to predictions from a logistic regression model.

In this contribution we therefore present the “fuzzy overlap”, that is a surrogate robustness measure which accounts for fuzzy activity duration.

This process is regularly affected by man-made impediments like strikes. Even then, some employees may still be available, e.g., since they are not organized in a union. Consequently, a strike of a single union is more a heavy decrease of capacity than a complete lock down of the railway system. In such events the timetable, rolling stock rotations, maintenance plans, and crew schedules have to be adapted. Optimization methods are particularly valuable in such situations in order to maintain a best possible level of service using the resources that are still available. Finding new or revised cyclic tours of rolling stock vehicles (rotations)\r\nthrough the timetable after disruptions is a well studied topic in the literature, see Cacchiani et al.

We consider a different, novel, and more integrated approach which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been described in the literature before. The idea is to guide the cancellation of the trips of the timetable by the rotation planning process, which is based on mixed integer programming.

Classical risk neutral approaches do not accommodate the risk aversion often encountered in practice. When risk aversion is considered, time-consistency becomes an important issue. However, there is no consensus in the literature on its definition, as several contradicting properties are desirable. In our approach, we use a nested risk-measure to ensure that decisions only depend on states that may realize in the future. In this context, we use the risk measure Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), which recently became popular in areas like finance, energy or supply chain management. \r\nA result is that the risk averse dynamic pricing problem can be transformed to a classical, risk neutral problem. To do so, a surprisingly simple modification of the selling probabilities suffices. Thus, all structural properties carry over. In addition, we show additional, risk-related properties. Moreover, we show that the risk averse and the risk neutral solution of the original problem are proportional under certain conditions.\r\nThis has straightforward implications for practice. On the one hand, it shows that existing dynamic pricing algorithms and systems can be kept in place and easily incorporate risk aversion.

It is highly likely that the large scale deployment of variable renewable energy sources (VREs) such as wind and solar will play an important role in meeting this challenge. Given the relatively low spatial energy density of VREs compared to conventional electricity generation, a significant growth in VREs often faces questions around social and environmental acceptance as well as technical limitations. Typically modellers optimise the whole energy system of a country at once at low spatial resolution and so do not consider locally specific social, environmental and technical constraints. Here we seek to study the impact of different levels of these constraints in a UK context, a country which has high public support for VREs at the national level but significant local opposition. To do this we take the following approach: 1) a detailed spatial analysis to develop scenarios of low, medium and high social, environment and technical constraints on VRE deployment, 2) input these into the UK focused cost optimising, high spatial and temporal resolution electricity system model highRES and 3) compare costs, deployment patterns and emissions across scenarios. We find that the costs of highly renewable electricity systems are considerably cheaper if the system optimal sites are developed, i.e. the model is allowed greater access to areas with a mix of higher capacity factors and a favourable timing of production.

Finished products are differentiated according to their quality levels, specified in two dimensions.

Our motivating example comes from the semiconductor industry; the two quality dimensions are processor speed and heat resistance. Every week the firm decides the number of wafers to order (each of which contains hundreds to thousands of \"chips\"), which will arrive about 10 weeks later. Upon arrival, an initial (quick) test is performed on each chip, which is then classified into one of several quality “bins.” At this point, all chips with an acceptable quality level are converted into so-called packaged devices. A more time-consuming test is required to determine the exact quality category; the final quality may be higher or lower than the initial quality. Every week, the firm must also decide how many packaged devices from each initial-quality bin should be tested and for which quality specifications each should be tested. The time required for a test generally increases in the quality level for which the device is being tested and the testing capacity is limited. In addition, the firm must allocate post-final-test chips to satisfy demand, recognizing the opportunity cost of fulfilling demand for low-quality products using higher-quality products.

In contrast, regulated airports choose their runway capacity investments in anticipation of future fleet planning of airlines and corresponding passenger growth. While capacity extensions of airports and fleet planning of airlines are highly interconnected, traditional planning processes typically ignored such an interplay. Therefore, in this paper we present a four-level market model that directly accounts for interdependent long-run investments of airlines and airports within a market environment. \r\n\r\nIn particular, on the first level we assume airports that choose their runway capacity extensions together with their level of charges. Airports anticipate the behavior of airlines that will (i) invest in their aircraft fleet on the second level, (ii) schedule their (existing and new) fleet on the third level, and (iii) sell their tickets on several markets on the fourth level. Obviously, all four levels are highly interconnected. For instance, the number of sold tickets on the fourth level depends on the aircraft that is scheduled on the considered connection on the third level, which in turn is influenced by investment decisions on the first and second level. On the opposite, optimal long-run investments depend on profits realized on the ticket market on the fourth level as well as on current policy regulations. \r\n\r\nGiven this complex interdependency, we reformulate the original four-level problem and solve the resulting single-level problem with a sub- and master problem decomposition.

With the help of condition-based maintenance, maintenance intervals can be optimized due to detailed knowledge of the machine condition through sensor data. This results in an adapted maintenance schedule where machines are only maintained when necessary.

The current conditions of the machines are used to forecast the necessary maintenance activities for several periods. A decision support system helps maintenance planners to choose their decision-making horizon flexibly. It can be decided individually how often the maintenance schedule is optimized anew.

However, in many real life situations this assumption is not fulfilled. There are many reasons making machines not available in some periods of time, e.g., the limited availability may result from maintenance activities, from overlapping of time horizons in rolling time horizon planning algorithms or it may be due to scheduling of tasks with various priorities. In general, in deterministic scheduling two cases are considered, i.e., the starting points of the non-availability periods are known in advance or they should be determined to meet some requirements (when they correspond to maintenance – in this case both, tasks and maintenance have to be scheduled).\r\n\tIn this work problems of scheduling tasks with ready times on a single machine with many non-availability periods are considered.

Free-flight trajectories are not aligned to an Air Travel Network (ATN), instead, the full 4D space (3D+time) is used for the computation of fuel-efficient trajectories that minimize the travel costs. From a computational point of view, the challenge is to find trajectories, composed of adjacent segments connecting two points (on the earth's surface), that avoid head-winds and benefit from tail-winds. The wind field usually differs in various flight levels (altitudes), therefore the speed of the aircraft and a flight altitude must be assigned to the segments composing the trajectory so the fuel consumption during the flight time is minimized. Moreover, a time constraint is always enforced in order not to incur extra costs due to early or late arrival. This problem is computationally difficult, therefore it is solved in practice, in two subsequent stages: a horizontal phase, in which the segments of a 2D trajectory are computed, and then a vertical phase, in which different altitudes are assigned to the segments. We propose a nonlinear programming model for the computation of Free-fight trajectories. This model requires continuous formulations of the problem's input data such as the fuel consumption and the weather data, hence approximation techniques are required. We integrate the formulation of these approximations into our NLP model using AMPL as modelling language along with the solvers SNOPT, KNITRO and MINOS.

In this talk general methods and concepts are given for linear PDEs with a finite set of control variables, which can be either binary or continuous. The presence of the binary variables restricts the feasible controls to a set of hyperplanes of the control space and makes conventional methods inapplicable. We show that under the assumption that all additional constraints of the system are linear, these problems can be modeled as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and numerically solved by a linear programming (LP) based branch-and-cut method. If the discretized PDE is directly used as constraints in the MILP, the problem size scales with the resolution of the discretization in both space and time. A reformulation of the model allows to solve the PDE in a preprocessing step, which not only helps to significantly reduce the number of constraints and computation time, but also makes it possible to use adaptive finite element methods.

This could be beneficial not only in terms of the environment and the society, but is also economically relevant. We address such an issue faced by a manufacturer who finds its optimal strategy by sourcing from two suppliers: one delivering virgin material, the other offering recycled material with uncertain yield and price. The focus of this work is to discuss how the integration of recycled material impacts a manufacturer's economic performance. Depending on the price difference between virgin and recycled material, we want to explore, which sourcing strategy is most desirable from an economic point of view. This is analyzed for a short life-cycle product in a single-period inventory model framework. As the delivery quantity of the recycler does not necessarily equal the order quantity, the following sourcing strategies are considered: 1. single sourcing from the recycler, 2. single sourcing from the virgin material supplier, 3. dual sourcing from recycling and virgin material supplier, 4. dual sourcing with recycling material as a main source and an emergency option of virgin material. For every sourcing strategy the optimal order quantities are provided that maximize manufacturer’s expected profit.

A challenge for introducing dynamic pricing, however, is that the free capacity of a container vessel is highly dependent on the composition of the type of containers to stow. For example, stowing many light reefer-containers often makes it impossible to stow heavier containers, even if it is within the ship’s nominal capacity w.r.t. TEU, reefer slots and weight. Capacity models that accurately describe the feasible cargo compositions are therefore needed; these can then be applied in cargo flow simulations used to compute the residual capacity of the shipping network, which is the basis for dynamic pricing.\r\nIn this work, we address the described problem by deriving accurate and compact capacity models from the detailed but large linear stowage optimization models recently published by Delgado et al.. This is done by abstracting away the unneeded information, such as the specific location of each container in the cargo. For this purpose, we have developed a hierarchically decomposed and parallel version of the Fourier-Motzkin elimination method, which projects the feasible solutions in a large dimensional space into a space of smaller dimension.  \r\nOur results show that our projected models are two orders of magnitude smaller than the initial stowage models and makes the cargo flow simulations more scalable without significant loss of accuracy.

In such a system, customer demand occurs at the retailers and propagates backward through the system. The warehouse and the retailers have a limited capacity for keeping inventory and if they are not able to fulfill the demand immediately, the demand will be lost. All the locations review their inventory periodically and replenish their inventory spontaneously based on a periodic randomized ordering (RO) policy. The RO policy determines order quantity of each location at each period by subtraction corresponding on-hand inventory at the beginning of that period from a deterministic decision variable. We propose a mathematical model to find the optimal RO policies such that an average systemwide cost consisting of ordering, holding, shortage, and surplus costs is minimized. We use the first and second moment of on-hand inventory as auxiliary variables. A remarkable advantage of our model is to calculate the immediate fill rate of all locations without adding new variables and facing the curse of dimensionality. Using two numerical examples with stationary and non-stationary demand settings, we validate and evaluate the proposed model. For the validation, we simulate the optimal RO policy and demonstrate that the optimal first and second moments of on-hand inventory from our model reasonably follow the corresponding moments obtained through simulation.

However, many DSM algorithms make assumptions regarding load characteristics. Thus, real world conditions (e. g. energy loads cannot be moved and paused in any order) are not implemented. Based on a prior review of DSM algorithms as well as several expert interviews we identified five constraints: horizontal and vertical separability of loads, time interval of use, environmental effects, and dependencies between loads. Although several experts highlighted the importance so far no investigation shows the impact of these constraints to DSM algorithms. Therefore, our research question is: Which impact do different constraints have to DSM algorithms?\r\nTo answer this question, we conducted a simulation with representative DSM algorithms. After implementing each constraint individually, we are able to switch these constraints on and off. As data for our simulation, we used artificial datasets with several predefined households derived by statistical analysis.\r\nAs a result of comparing the outcomes regarding different key indicators, such as costs, savings, peak-to-average-ratio, and mean-squared-error (MSE), we can conclude that the constraints have an impact on the results.

ECOP can be described as finding the best way to allocate a political party’s resources among different election locations in order to maximize the seats or member of parliaments (MPs) won.

The main problem addressed in this study is called as the tour scheduling problem which assigns work shifts and work days to employees such that the time-varying customer demand is satisfied with minimum cost. Organizations may implement a variety of flexible scheduling policies to deal with this variable customer demand. Applying flexible shift start times is one of the scheduling policies that may lead to a significant reduction in labor cost. However, this policy may assign work shifts to employees which start at different hours on each working day of the employee. Since the shift start times of an employee may vary a great deal across the working days, shift start time bands should be implemented to reduce the shift start time variations to a certain level. Another policy that can increase the scheduling efficiency is the flexible break assignments. In this policy, break time windows are used to provide flexibility in break time assignments. Additionally, managers may obtain flexibility in employee schedules by including different shift lengths and days-on patterns. The main objective of this study is to develop an iterative decomposition based matheuristic that can solve the TSP covering all of these flexible scheduling policies.

In these systems, the maximum work-in-process inventory (WIP) at each stage of the production is limited by the corresponding number of Kanban cards. The inventory between the stages is used to hedge against the randomness of the demand and of the production process. However, the traditional Kanban system is made for static environments. Dynamic changes in system characteristics can occur within a production system itself or may be induced by customers, e.g., because of seasonal patterns in demand.  We consider a production system with serially arranged stations that serves a stochastic and time-dependent demand from a finished goods buffer. The goal is to minimize the expected value of the average WIP in the system over a finite planning horizon while guaranteeing a service level.  We introduce a new Proactive Kanban (PK) control, which features planned changes in the Kanban allocation at predefined points in time to account for future changes in the demand and the processing time distributions. The key decision for the PK control is the number of Kanban cards allocated over time. We show that for a single-stage system with exponentially distributed processing times, with time-dependent mean, and non-homogenous Poisson demand, the average backlogged orders decrease monotonically and the expected average WIP increases monotonically in the time-dependent Kanban allocation. To determine the optimal number of Kanban cards per stage and period in a serial line, a simulation-optimization approach is proposed.

The costs of repositioning empty containers could be reduced if the involved ocean carriers would or could cooperate more intensively. However, in many situations sharing the necessary data among competing carriers is not an option due to privacy concerns. Therefore, in order to balance supply and demand of empty containers we propose an exchange mechanism based on a double auction.

In the proposed auction, the bidders buy and sell the right to use a number of empty containers at a specific location on a certain day defined by their bids. A bidder may combine multiple individual bids into a bundle bid. Bundle bidding avoids the exposure problem. By means of bundle bidding, a bidder is able to construct a transport network which is more balanced with respect to supply and demand of empty containers.

In our approach, derived from Partially Observable Stochastic Games, each agent has an individualized information set and model, from which they derive decisions. Agents measure the performance of previous decisions according to one or more metrics. The outcome of their decisions emerges from the combination of all individual models. Agents repeatedly decide and act over multiple turns, continuously updating their information set via observed changes in the environment. For example, in a sponsored search auction, multiple firms bid on the ranking of their advertisements on a website given a particular keyword. In this context, a high ranking of ads is desirable. Thus, agents can represent firms who place bids based on information on past rankings, the resulting revenues, as well as a given marketing strategy and budget. \r\n\r\nDecomposing the agent-based model into agents and their environment allows modelers to calibrate each component separately, estimating their parameters. Outputs from the agents and their interaction with the environment can be validated separately against observations from each component.

Complex contracts are used, for example, to align suppliers in a supply chain. Negotiations among multiple agents easily get stuck in a local optimum because the agents block each others proposals. Many negotiation mechanism are mediator-driven, i.e., they assume a new contract proposal is generated by a neutral mediator. However, as the agents are not willing to disclose private information about their utility functions, the search process of the mediator is uninformed. Therefore, mediator-based ANMs usually use randomized contract proposal mechanisms. This preserves private information of the agents but may extend the negotiation process considerably.\r\n\r\nA way to overcome this deficit may be to allow agents to propose their own contracts. As agents propose contracts, each new proposal benefits at least one agent. In contrast, in mediator-driven negotiations many contracts proposed by the (uninformed) mediator may not be improving at all. On the other hand, agent-driven negotiations may get stuck in local optima even faster and, therefore, result in inferior contracts. In these agent-driven negotiations the performance depends, among others, on the sequence in which the agents are allowed to propose new contracts. We study the impact of three different sequences (random, static, result-dependent) on the performance of four ANMs: greedy, greedy with compensation payments, simulated annealing, and simulated annealing with compensation payments.

Among them, introducing RE sources is primarily of importance in terms of improving energy self-sufficiency ratio and reducing the volume of CO2 emissions. This paper evaluates the impact of RE sources on market outcomes in Japan.

Our model is positioned as part of the optimal generation mix model and enables us to simulate power plants' hourly operations that minimize the total variable cost under several constraints such as demand-supply balances and transmission constraints. Using scenarios proposed by the government, we find that the diffusion of RE sources would lower the kWh-market prices and greenhouse gases by reducing fossil fuel consumption in 2030. It would also mothball many of the thermal power plants, which were active and profitable in 2015.

The MDVSP deals with the sequencing and assignment of a set of timetabled trips to buses, which are stationed at different depots. A sequence of the trips corresponds to a schedule for a bus to which the trips are assigned. A bus may need to travel empty from the end location of one trip to the start location of its next trip. Such bus trips are referred to as deadheading trips or repositioning trips. One of the objectives of the MDVSP is to minimise deadheading and hence, the total deadheading cost. The second MDVSP objective is to minimise the number of buses that are required for covering all the trips. We have developed a three-stage algorithm to solve the MDVSP. The first stage converts the MDVSP to a single depot vehicle scheduling problem using a suitable relaxation procedure. In the second stage, a feasible solution is obtained using the solution to the single depot problem from the first stage. The third stage involves an iterative procedure to improve the initial feasible solution. Each iteration involves randomly dividing the entire scheduling horizon into two partitions. Improvements to the solution, if any, can be obtained by determining the optimal connections that 'join' the two partitions. An assignment formulation is solved to get the optimal connections. The best of these solutions obtained in the second and third stage is selected as the solution to the MDVSP. We tested the algorithm using benchmark instances.

Firstly on the demand side, where in the electricity sector gas power plants provide flexibility with lower emissions than lignite or coal power plants. However, gas power plants currently suffering from low electricity prices and thus the future level of gas demand in this sector is unclear. Secondly, uncertainties raise on the supply side, where decreasing Europe-an gas production in western Europe enhance the market position of non-European suppliers as Russia or Qatar and simultaneously increase the European dependence on supplies of these countries. Finally, uncertainties grow on the transmission side, where Russia tries to build new transmission routes to Europe e.g. Nord Stream II and Turkish Stream.

Consider, for instance, the delivery of goods to retailers or regular technical maintenance tasks. In these applications, the entire region under study is subdivided into service territories, with one field representative being responsible for all customers in a territory.  At a tactical planning level, customer visits within each service territory must be scheduled over a given planning horizon. The goal is to determine a valid visit schedule for each customer that meets customer-specific requirements such as visiting rhythms. In addition, the schedule must achieve a balanced daily and weekly workload. Lastly, compactness is important, as field representatives need to travel to their customers, and thus visits on the same day should be geographically concentrated.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present a column generation formulation of the resulting scheduling problem and propose an exact branch-and-price algorithm.

In particular, field service planning — the process of allocating field service employees to spatially distributed service requests, remains a challenge largely managed by dispatchers with little technical support. To increase planning efficiency many companies are evaluating decision support systems (DSS) and automation. The operations research community has developed numerous exact and approximate solution methods for similar problems, but in some cases the applicability of these solutions to real-world problems is limited. Previous research has identified that the complex, deterministic, and dynamic nature of the field service planning process makes it a unique problem. \r\n\r\nThis work focuses on two aspects: (A) Industrial field service planning requires multiple preparation steps — e.g. problem identification, task prioritization, request to employee matching, and planning parameters estimation (e.g. future demand, characteristics of requests), before requests can be scheduled. As companies rely on dispatchers, their decision processes and accumulated knowledge are tacit and, therefore, currently cannot be leveraged for DSS and automation. (B) Dispatchers often experience cognitive overload as multiple information sources must be evaluated simultaneously under time pressure. Simple DSSs, which automatically estimate planning parameters that are difficult to estimate manually, can already enable dispatchers to focus their attention where it is needed most. \r\n\r\nExemplary, a data-driven DSS for the robust prediction of planning parameters, based on historic service information and (often incomplete) real-time data, is presented and evaluated.

Our centralized daycare planning maximizes the overall satisfaction of families with the assignment, which is measured by the aggregated valuations of the facilities from the perspective of families. \r\nIn a second step, we address the problem of symmetric solutions of our daycare planning model.

Users simply submit a problem (SAT, MIP, CP, QP and soon, MINLP) to a cloud server, and the SolveEngine selects the best-suited solver for that particular problem. The SolveEngine is algorithm agnostic, and is constantly updated with algorithms from both academic and commercial communities, ensuring the system is consistently cutting edge. User’s pay only for the SolveTime they use, and algorithm providers generate revenue from royalties. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will outline which solvers, algorithms, modelling languages and solve systems have already been integrated into the SolveEngine. We will describe how everyday users can access the SolveEngine, and for more advanced users, explain how existing systems can access the SolveEngine through our API’s. We will provide details of our beta version, and explain how machine learning will be used to extract features from your problem in order to determine which solver to send it to and continuously improve the performance of the SolveEngine. We will conclude with a description of how algorithm creators can seamlessly integrate their own algorithms into the SolveEngine and start generating revenue to fund future development, as well as gain and insights into the performance of their creations to support further development and advancement.

We distinguish three cases: a static one where no wind is blowing, and two cases where we regard wind as a function of time. This allows us to model HFTOP as a Shortest Path Problem in the first case and a Time-Dependent Shortest Path Problem in the latter cases.\r\n\r\nIn the static case, we compare the runtimes of Dijkstra's algorithm to those of A* and Contraction Hierarchies (CHs). We show that A* guided by a great-circle-distance potential yields speedups competitive to those of CHs.\r\n\r\nIn the time-dependent version, we study two different modelling approaches. Firstly, we compute the exact costs for the time on the arcs. In a second version, we use piecewise linear functions as the travel time. For both versions, we design problem-specific potential functions for the A* algorithm. As the exact costs are non-linear, we introduce the notion of Super-Optimal Wind to underestimate the travel time on the arcs, and show that Super-Optimal Wind yields a good underestimation in theory and an excellent approximation in practice. Moreover, we compare the runtimes of the time dependent versions of Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* and Time-dependent Contraction Hierarchies (TCHs) in the PWL case, showing that A* outperforms Dijkstra's Algorithm by a factor of 25 and TCHs by a factor of more than 16.\r\n\r\nFor the exact case, we compare Dijkstra's Algorithm to A* and show that using Super-Optimal Wind to guide the search leads to an average speedup of 20.", :title " Solving the Time-Dependent Shortest Path Problem on Airway Networks Using Super-Optimal Wind", :keyword2 0, :authors (52534), :session 397949}, 1086 {:keyword1 175, :keyword3 95, :abstract "As the demand for home delivery continues to grow, so too does the need for organisations to implement more efficient delivery operations. For our clients, the constraints imposed on home delivery are numerous - and it is a challenge that causes many organisations to struggle. Our clients have any number of vehicles, each with limited capacity. Vehicles are limited to certain routes, and routes are often limited by traffic, accidents or road closures. Add driver shifts, multiple destinations and the rising desire for nominated time-window delivery (slots) and you get a scheduling problem no human operator can solve with any degree of accuracy. Our data-driven, operations research approach has, and will continue to improve the efficiency of home delivery; reducing costs for our clients, and vastly improving the customer experience. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, as well as discussing the above in more depth, we will describe how optimisation and machine learning can be leveraged to build highly impactful last-mile delivery solutions. We will illustrate, through case studies from our own consulting experiences, how some of the UK’s largest retailers are using optimisation to schedule their fleets of vehicles, and disclose just how impactful it has been for their costs, and their customers.

Lots of data with complex models and relations shall be processed as fast as possible and should lead to most accurate solutions. People who are responsible for processes need at least support in their decision-making which leads to an increasing demand on optimization in all sectors. This lecture shows how the inola Optimization Core, a self-learning, metaheuristic optimization technology, based on object-oriented programming, makes this possible. The technology integrates domain-specific-knowledge, enabling it to act instinctively, thus being effective like the decision maker himself. Additionally, it is also possible to embed well-explored solution-strategies. The optimization system learns from the on-going-optimization process, identifies good working solution-strategies and thereby influences the further completion. This leads to consistently better and fast-available solutions. Results can be requested at any time in the optimization process which leads to an interference-free process flow for all users. Concluding, two practical examples and results from warehouse logistics and integrated block duty planning in public transport are presented to show how to use this technology, how it can be integrated into other systems and how the user can be assisted optimally.

By different parameter settings, our model may be reduced to either a two- or three-dimensional Bin Packing Problem. We propose practical applications of this problem in production and logistics. We further introduce lower bounds, and heuristics for upper bounds. We can demonstrate for a variety of instance classes proposed in literature that the GAP between those bounds is rather low.

Crowd-sourced floating car data and big data processing have paved the way to extremely accurate historic speed profiles and up-to-the-minute real-time traffic information. Advanced routing algorithms make use of this abundance of data to outsmart traffic and reduce congestion, contributing to more efficient mobility for all.\r\n\r\nToday, electric vehicles create new navigation challenges like optimizing routes for consumption and charging stops, or accurately estimating vehicle range based on advanced consumption models. Connected cars becoming the norm have opened up opportunities for more and richer navigation services, like incremental over-the-air map updates, on-street parking assistance, and an increasing level of personalization and contextual awareness in navigation.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, navigation is a key innovation area on the path towards automated driving.
