However, if this buyer’s unreliable supplier has limited resources to process this order, the situation may become different. We propose a scheme named pricing support purchase order financing, under which it may be the buyer’s best interest to raise the purchase price such that the value increment of the order (as the loan mortgage) can reduce the supplier’s obstacles in financing. \r\nIn this study, a Stackelberg model is used to illustrate the interaction between the buyer and the supplier. For a rational supplier, his optimal input quantity shall depend on the order price set by the powerful buyer. It is verified that when the price is lower than the supplier’s break-even value, it is optimal for him to give up the deal. When the price is between the break-even value and the supplier’s sweet spot, it is optimal that the supplier takes his input equal to the buyer’s order size. Otherwise, the supplier is better off enlarging his input to ensure fulfilling the entire order. \r\nThe buyer can foresee supplier’s response and design the purchasing contract accordingly. First, we verify that the buyer’s optimal order size is a step function of the order price. Second, we prove that there are only four types of design in the collection of the optimal purchasing contracts. Sometimes, waiving the supplier is preferred.

Suppliers are also discouraged from EE investment by the uncertainty associated with new technologies.\r\nThese issues are studied via our model of the bargaining process, in a two-tier supply chain, between a single supplier and buyer; we analyze how the supplier's EE technology adoption is affected by the buyer's relative bargaining power and also by technology uncertainty. We compare various contracting arrangements commonly used in industry to overcome these obstacles, including price commitment by the buyer and shared investment contracts while characterising their optimal properties with respect to different criteria---in particular, supply chain profit and the equilibrium level of EE investment. In terms of both criteria, we find that shared investment contracts perform better than price commitment contracts, although the latter increase supplier profit when a buyer's bargaining power is relatively high. We also show that, in a two-player model, the bargaining process between firms moderates how uncertainty affects supplier's investment behaviour.\r\n", :title "Energy Efficiency Contracting in Supply Chains under Asymmetric Bargaining Power", :keyword2 31, :authors (40815), :session 508}, 25 {:keyword1 29, :keyword3 133, :abstract "Renewable energy resources are clean and local energy production alternatives. Thus, they also have become important instruments for energy policies of countries. One of the most common used renewable energy resources is wind energy. While wind energy technologies increase day by day; investment, operation, and maintenance costs of wind energy sector are decrease. Therefore, wind farms have become more popular all over the world. Wind energy is also very popular instrument for Turkey by its high potential. The future of wind energy looks like a bright area for Turkey in both short and long term. While the value of installed wind power plants increases, monitoring and optimization of current wind energy sites becomes an emerging area. If a wind farm could be monitored dynamically and correctly, the anomalies in the system would be detected even before it occurred. Thus, in this study, a particle filtering approach is modeled to monitor wind power of a wind turbine, which gives many messages about health of wind turbine. Wind speed and wind power data, which were gathered from the SCADA system within 10 minutes intervals, were used as modeling parameters. The generated wind power was monitored by proposed Particle Filtering algorithm where the wind speed used as a predictor measurement for the generated wind power of a wind turbine. The proposed model was tested on a real data of a wind farm in Turkey.", :title "Modelling of Wind Speed and Generated Power of a Wind Turbine by Using Particle Filtering to Monitor a Wind Farm", :keyword2 28, :authors (30797 20650), :session 146}, 28 {:keyword1 35, :keyword3 99, :abstract "The aim of this research is to investigate the existence of sensors which may aid in the monitoring of Equity Markets. While the classical approach consists in studying the stock market following the evolution of individual stocks, we use a so-called macroscopic viewpoint by considering a global view of the equity markets. This method enables us to extract significant information about the overall dynamics. This way, we see the market within the context of the principles of mass and momentum conservation and the variables density, flux, pressure, average velocity, etc. We can then define `sensors' that can monitor some of these variables in the market. In the era of high frequency trading, powerful tools are needed to monitor and control these activities in markets. We propose a method that predicts and provides alerts in the case of such abnormal activities. Our preliminarily analysis shows that our sensors capture valuable information during the flash crash day in which the volatility was extraordinarily high and which was created by high frequency trading.", :title "Macroscopic look at the Equity Markets", :keyword2 93, :authors (49792), :session 619}, 29 {:keyword1 54, :keyword3 152, :abstract "Many service systems provide multiple types or levels of services, often through a hierarchy of service facilities. Emergency service and Information Technology (IT) equipment support services are examples where the responses are provided within certain time windows and the services are differentiated on this bases. Locating facilities for such services is commonly dealt with as a covering problem. However, service operations such as IT equipment maintenance and highway maintenance also require maintaining inventories of parts and materials that are required for providing the services at the demand points. This adds another dimension to the problem as inventory cost can also influence the optimum location pattern and service area configurations. We study the trade-off between inventory and transportation costs when determining the setup of facilities and service areas for time (distance) constrained services. We present a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model to study the optimum locations of hierarchical facilities and their service zones for two time-based services. The model considers the minimum number of facilities of each type and the fraction of demand associated with each time-based service type. This multifaceted problem is explored on a line segment, which can be related to serving uniformly distributed customers on one road, to highlight the operational issues and generate insights for more complex situations.", :title "Optimizing hierarchical facility location and service zones with multiple distance constraints: Exploring the problem on one route", :keyword2 157, :authors (49780 12970), :session 887}, 33 {:keyword1 96, :keyword3 8, :abstract "The paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem with random machine breakdowns by using schedule-risk measure we have developed. A machine breakdown will postpone the finishing time of the interrupted operation, and then may delay the schedule makespan. Once a schedule runs, it will face a risk of deteriorated stability and makespan. To control the schedule-risk, a method of inserting time-buffer among operations of a schedule is studied. A heuristic procedure based on greedy algorithm which will insert time-buffer at the operation located in the critical path of the schedule, is developed. In ordere to improve the efficiency of the heuristic procedure, a quick location measure of inserting time-buffer which combine the probability and influence range of the machine breakdown on an operation, is presented. An extensive simulation-based analysis of the performance of the proposed method has been conducted. The results show that our method can decrease the schedule-risk significantly and the quick location measure can improve efficiency of inserting in a large extent.", :title "Risk Control of Job Shop Scheduling with Random Machine Breakdowns", :keyword2 170, :authors (49806), :session 901}, 34 {:keyword1 96, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The vessel body assembly consists of manufacturing and welding metal components. Each component passes three production stages in the same order: 1) cutting a billet from a metal sheet, 2) fabricating component from the billet, and 3) welding component with the framework and other components of the vessel body. Operations on different components do not intersect in time in each stage, and the three operations on the same component do not intersect in time. The order of welding operations is restricted by precedence constraints. The operation processing times are all known. The problem is to find a feasible schedule such that the makespan is minimized. This problem is a variation of the classic strongly NP-hard three-machine flow-shop scheduling problem (Johnson 1954), in which operations in the third stage must satisfy precedence constraints (Gladky, Shafransky and Strusevich 2004). There exists an optimal schedule for the classic problem, called permutation schedule, in which components sequence is the same in each stage. It is not the case if precedence constraints are given in the third stage. However, in the real-life problem, it is required that the components sequence is the same in each stage. Thus, the real-life problem can be modeled by the three-stage permutation flow-shop scheduling problem, which is to find a permutation schedule such that the precedence constraints are satisfied and the makespan is minimized. We suggest a Genetic Algorithm to solve this problem.", :title "Vessel Body Assembly Planning as a Three-Stage Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem", :keyword2 0, :authors (18010 49807 49809 49799 49808), :session 178}, 36 {:keyword1 45, :keyword3 171, :abstract "We present a case study which uses simulation to analyze the patient flow at a hospital emergency department in Hong Kong.

A short glance to the literature of algorithms and optimization indicates that IF and OF are mainly applicable as considerable criteria to compare each pair of generated solutions. Furthermore, we test CSA and its structure using a benchmark Knapsack Problem.", :title "Chemotherapy Science Algorithm (CSA) to Solve Knapsack Problem", :keyword2 57, :authors (50132 827), :session 868}, 126 {:keyword1 16, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Cutting and Packing problems are hard combinatorial optimization problems that arise in the context of several manufacturing and process industries or in their supply chains. These problems occur whenever a bigger object or space has to be divided into smaller objects or spaces, so that waste is minimized. This is the case when cutting paper rolls in the paper industry, large wood boards into smaller rectangular panels in the furniture industry, irregularly shaped garment parts from fabric rolls in the apparel industry, but also the case when packing boxes on pallets and these inside trucks or containers, in logistics applications. All these problems have in common the existence of a geometric sub-problem, which deals with the small object non-overlap constraints.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of these problems is not only a scientific challenge, given its intrinsic difficulty, but has also a great economic impact as it contributes to the decrease of one of the major cost factors for many production sectors: the raw-materials. In some industries raw-material may represent up to 40% of the total production costs. It has also a significant environmental repercussion as it leads to a less intense exploration of the natural resources from where the raw-materials are extracted, and decreases the quantity of garbage generated, which frequently has also important environmental impacts. In logistics applications, minimizing container and truck loading space waste directly leads to less transportation needs and therefore to smaller logistics costs and less pollution.\r\n\r\nIn this talk the several Cutting and Packing problems will be characterized and exemplified, based on Gerhard Wäscher’s typology (2007), allowing non-specialists to have a broad view over the area. Afterwards, as geometry plays a critical role in these problems, the geometric manipulation techniques more relevant for Cutting and Packing problems resolution will be presented. Finally, aiming to illustrate some of the most recent developments in the area, some approaches based on heuristics and metaheuristics, for the container loading problem, and based on mathematical programming models, for the irregular packing problem, will be described.  \r\n", :title "Waste Minimization: the Contribution of Cutting and Packing Problems for a More Competitive and Environmentally Friendly Industry", :keyword2 0, :authors (663), :session 164}, 129 {:keyword1 126, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This study relates to optimal control problem for two stage  variable structure control system and its application for handling complex societal problems in a transparent and structured way.

Under this scheme, people believe that the most effective place to improve the performance of a production line is to improve the performance of its bottleneck. Since the improvement on an upstream workstation may have an impact on its downstream servers, finding the true bottleneck is not trivial in a stochastic production line. Due to the analytical intractability of general tandem queues, we develop methods to quantify the dependence among stations through simulation. Dependence is defined by the contribution queue time at each station, and contribution factors are developed based on the insight from Friedman’s reduction method and Jackson networks. In a tandem queue, the dependence among stations can be either diffusion or blocking, and their impact depends on the positions relative to the bottlenecks. Based on these results, we show that improving the performance of the system bottleneck may not be the most effective place to reduce system sojourn time.

This problem is much more difficult than the classical bin-packing problem, and hence is more challenging.

Despite the practical relevance and ubiquity of integer or logical decision variables such as valves, gears or the start-up of sub-units in chemical plants, optimization methods capable of solving such nonlinear mixed-integer optimal control problems (MIOCP) for large-scale systems and in real-time have only recently come within reach. \r\nNonlinear MIOCP such as the minimum energy operation of subway trains equipped with discrete acceleration modes were solved as early as the late seventies for the city of New York. Indeed one can prove that the Pontryagin Maximum Principle holds which makes an indirect solution approach feasible. Based on the “Competing Hamiltonians Algorithm” (Bock, Longman ’81), open loop and feedback solutions for problems with discontinuous dynamics were computed that allowed a tested reduction of 18 per cent in traction energy. However, such \"indirect\" methods are relatively complex to apply and numerically less suitable for large-scale real-time optimization problems. \r\nWe present a new \"direct\" approach based on a functional analytic approach leading to a relaxed problem without integer gap, the so-called “outer convexification” which is then solved by a modification of the direct multiple shooting method as an \"all-at-once\" approach.

The fundamental idea comes from the analysis of the feasible region for these types of strategies. It is noticeable that Stackelberg leader has a feasible region that is larger and includes all Nash equilibria and, hence, it is better than, or at least equal to, all Nash equilibria. Similarly, the feasible region for a cooperative game is larger and includes all non-cooperative game solutions, so that they compose the best possible solutions for a game. Numeric examples can be used to demonstrate these relationships, which are applicable to any game since no premises on functions are considered.

The  problem arises from scarce resources (locations) at which large ships can only pass each other in opposing directions. \r\n\r\nThis is a prototype problem for traffic management and routing in logistic systems. One wants to utilize the available street or logistic network in such a way that the network “load” is minimized or the “throughput” is maximized.  The aspects of “time” and “congestion” play a crucial role in these problems and require new techniques that need to integrate dynamic network flows and scheduling.\r\n\r\nThe lecture will illustrate recent developments in this direction on the example of the Kiel Canal problem, which which was a project with the German Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration. Here certain ships must wait in sidings to let opposing traffic pass. This requires to decisions on who should wait for whom (scheduling), in which siding to wait (packing) and when and how far to steer a ship between sidings (routing), and all this for online arriving ships at both sides of the canal. \r\n\r\nThe combination of routing and scheduling (without the packing) leads to a new class of scheduling problems dealing with scheduling bidirected traffic on a path, and we will address recent complexity and approximation results for this class.\r\n\r\nFor the full problem, we need a feasible assignment of parking slots within sidings over time that is consistent with the scheduling decisions between the sidings and the routing. To that end, we used a routing algorithm that we had developed earlier for routing automated guided vehicles in a container terminals (cooperation with HHLA). We will explain details of this algorithm and show how to combine it with a rolling horizon technique for the scheduling and packing decisions in the canal. This provides a unified view of routing and scheduling that blends simultaneous (global) and sequential (local) solution approaches to allocate scarce network resources to a stream of online arriving vehicles in a collision-free manner.\r\n\r\nComputational experiments on real traffic data with results obtained by human expert planners show that our combinatorial algorithm improves upon manual planning by 25%.

In multi-unit organisations such as a bank and its branches or a national body delivering publicly funded health or education services through local operating units, the need arises to incentivize the units to operate efficiently.

Moreover, reducing the sailing speed of vessels requires adding more vessels into the service in order to guarantee a weekly call at each port in the service. In a competitive market, there may exist also a relationship between the sailing speed and the transport demand where customers can switch to a faster liner service if the sailing speed of their usual liner service is reduced, which constitutes an elastic demand case. On the other hand, vessel speed reduction is a mean to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transportation that is proportional to fuel consumption.

Pareto sets are then identified using three different bi-objective optimization methods. The models are tested using two services deployed in January 2010.

One pricing practice that is not as well recognized involves the use of mileage bands. Mileage bands segregate route distances into windows, with the cost per mile (generally) decreasing as the mileage increases. For example, the cost for a route within the band of 500 to 599 miles may be $1.65 per mile, decreasing to $1.60 per mile for a route in the band of 600 to 699 miles. In most TSPs, the cost of a route generally increases linearly with distance. However, with mileage bands a feasible solution must be fully completed in order to determine the per mile cost. Traditional methods through which piecewise linear costs are enforced via constraints cannot be applied to this problem. This research presents an algorithm that iteratively solves a modified version of the TSP to find the route length that results in the lowest cost using mileage bands. Further, an MIP algorithm is proposed to construct mileage bands that maximize profit for a carrier while minimizing the distance traveled. While a shipper may make scheduling adjustments in order to increase the route length to achieve a lower mileage rate, the carrier is interested in applying a set of mileage bands that limit the opportunities for these types of adjustments.

In both cases, the optimization can be performed considering operational and quality costs, finding the trade-off between the agency’s and the user’s interests. Since the DARPTW is NP-hard, several strategies have been proposed in order to deal with large instances, including the cluster-first-route-second strategy.

In case of a stock-out risk, a manufacturer has to request a premium freight from its supplier. However, premium freights incur very high cost to manufacturers in a short time-frame. Therefore, minimization of premium freights should be considered as an objective in addition to minimization of holding cost. Thus, a multi-objective simulation-based optimization algorithm is developed to determine supplier flexibility and safety stock levels yielding best premium freight and holding cost performance.

Borrowers in needs of money can easily get access to credit via online lending such as Peer-to-Peer lending, however due to information asymmetry  borrowers may undermine the agreement due to early repayment or default, which are two major concerns for the platform and lenders, since both affect the profitability of a loan. While default risk is frequently focused on in credit scoring literature, prepayment has received much less attention, despite a higher prepayment rate being observed in online lending when compared with default.

Team performance was assessed by the time required to complete the personnel scheduling task they were assigned and the cost associated with their final schedule.

Our empirical study based on vacuum cleaner data supports our theoretical predictions.  First, the first review significantly affects two key metrics of WOM, volume and valence (e.g., compared to products with a positive first review, products with a negative first review suffer more than 50% loss in WOM volume). Second, the first review effect not only persists, but also can intensify over time. Specifically, although the impact of the first review on WOM valence declines over time, a negative (positive) first review leads to a significantly lower (higher) WOM valence even after 36 months since the first review was posted. More strikingly, the first review effect on WOM volume exaggerates rather than diminishes as time goes by. Together, these results underscores the crucial role of a product’s very first consumer review.

We developed a holistic process which determines project priorities deduced from a scenario based capability approach. Subsequently, an adapted genetic algorithm (GA) is used to identify feasible schedules minimizing the makespan subject to resources availabilities and precedence constraints. We analyze the structural similarity of already existing schedules due to the cost trade-off between replanning and the benefits of the optimized solution. With the help of a comprehensive management cockpit, we involve decision makers into the optimization process.

A surprisingly common assumption is that a more important criterion will tend to have a larger weight, as if weights and importance were the same thing, or at least heavily correlated.

The cost performance of green-SDDS is quantified by a cost model that finds an optimal green-SDDS strategy with the minimal sum of travel time cost, fuel cost, and emission cost. An emission-based heuristic algorithm is presented to efficiently solve a large scale green-SDDS problem. Our emission-based algorithm is shown to be computationally efficient.

In this problem, drivers start and end their working day at home and have a limited working time per day. The quantity available in harvest points is typically several truckloads and full truckloads are thus supposed. The cost function is proportional to the total number of working days (by all drivers), and time windows at the harvest and demand points are not included. The characteristics of the case allow us to propose an integer optimization model which is easy to implement and solve. In particular, the model does not include the order in which forests are visited by a driver. While the log-truck scheduling problem is often related to pickup and delivery problems in the literature, the order of the nodes in the route do not have to be included in our modeling, as truck flow balancing is sufficient.

Companies generally divide customers into different marketing segments to increase profits due to the growing focus on customer relationship management (CRM). For new product launches, developing marketing strategies towards customers in different segments is a critical issue faced by companies. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fuzzy optimization method to select marketing strategies for new products based on similar cases. In the proposed method, a case database and a target case are constructed that consist of relevant data about historical products and a new product, respectively. Then, historical similar cases are retrieved based on similarities and adapted according to the current situation. Next, triangular fuzzy numbers are used to describe customers’ responses to the marketing strategies. Finally, a fuzzy integer linear model is constructed. By solving this model, marketing strategies for the new product towards customers in different segments can be obtained.

This is known as Expansion Planning\r\nand can be modeled as a nonconvex MINLP, where discrete decisions correspond to the operation of active network elements and nonlinearities are due to the flow-pressure relationship in pipes. An appreciated extension method in practice is to build new pipes in parallel to existing ones, called looping. Compared to the original pipe, a loop provides the possibility of transporting more gas and leads to a reduction of the pressure loss.\r\n\r\nThe decisions to be taken comprise the selection of the pipes to be looped, the continuous loop lengths as well as the appropriate choice of loop diameters out of a discrete set. Since we are able to determine the best looping diameters a priori, we can efficiently reduce the problem size of the resulting MINLP. This model is still nonconvex but we solve it to global optimality using outer approximation and spatial branching.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we focus on theoretical and practical aspects of loop extensions.

Using copulas to model the joint distribution of (positive) dependent demands we extend Corbett and Rajaram’s (2006) result and prove that for our pooling models the profit decreases with increasing demand dependence. Further we prove that, if the environmental constraint is binding, inventory and emissions decrease with increasing demand dependence.

For example, a merchant vessel on route to a port may want to avoid areas with inclement weather conditions such as high sea states, while a warship may want to patrol areas known for illicit activities such as smuggling or piracy. At first, these problems seem only loosely related. One common thread, however, is the presence of risk, which may vary in space and in time. \r\nThis contribution proposes a simple approach to propagating vessel route under forecastable risk. Namely, it advocates building a weighted directed graph of the possible routes over the planning horizon, where each vertex is a waypoint and each arc represents a route segment weighted by the corresponding risk value. Through this lens, propagating vessel routes conditioned upon risk corresponds to a minimum-cost flow problem, where the risk encountered by a vessel is either maximized or minimized depending on the objective (e.g., deterring illicit activities).\r\nThe approach is illustrated in the context of counter-piracy operations off the Horn of Africa where warships aim to deter and interdict pirates. Such a scenario is germane to current operations conducted under the aegis of the NATO’s Operation Ocean Shield.

We introduce stochastic demand for physician staffing using a scenario-based approach. To incorporate this kind of uncertainty in the scheduling process, we extend flexible shift scheduling (i.e., variable shift starting times and shift lengths) by allowing variable shift extensions. If a variable shift extension is scheduled, the physician knows that with a given probability he or she may have to work few periods longer. Thus, we ensure matching supply with demand and at the same time we increase predictability of working hours for the physicians. We propose a mixed-integer linear program to model the strategic problem and then we present a column generation based heuristic to solve our model. We evaluate the model using experimental data from a large German university hospital with approximately 1200 beds. Our computational experiments demonstrate that our approach manages to reduce unplanned overtime by more than 80 per cent with a constant workforce. In cases of similar levels of unplanned overtime, the required workforce level may be decreased by 20 per cent.

One optimization problem that arises in block yard management is the scheduling of yard cranes subject to time windows with the objective to minimize the maximal lateness. This planning task usually comprises the assignment of jobs to cranes, the sequencing of jobs per crane and the scheduling of job executions. We consider a very common yard configuration, a block storage system with two identical automated gantry cranes, called twin cranes. Since the cranes in this system cannot pass one another, each crane exclusively serves either the landside or the seaside of the terminal and so the jobs are assigned accordingly. We introduce a polynomial-time algorithm for the scheduling of the cranes. As the sequencing part of the planning task is already NP-complete, this problem is solved heuristically.

In this study we investigate how to manage the delivery price dynamically to steer customers’ choices of time slots to enhance the e-grocer's profit.

Unlike revenue management in airline, the second part relies on the solution of a full routing problem which is itself NP-hard. To provide an instant online estimation to the additional delivery cost, we propose a geographical decomposition of the service area based on a continuous routing distance approximation strategy, and use ADP with linear regression to calculate the opportunity cost. The resulting model balances out the unfairness for orders arriving at different times over the booking horizon, and effectively increases the average revenue of the accepted orders.

In each cycle the current jobs start at the same time on their corresponding machines and are moved to the next machine simultaneously once all jobs have finished processing. The time of a cycle is thus determined by the maximum processing times of the jobs. Motivated by a practical application, each job additionally requires a resources (workpiece carrier) during its whole processing. After a job is completed, the corresponding resource may immediately be used by the next job starting on the first machine. If the resource is not feasible for the starting job, it must be changed. These setup times in general do not occur between jobs that directly succeed each other in the production sequence. The goal is to find a permutation of the jobs as well as a feasible assignment of resources to the jobs such that the production time (sum of times of the cycles and sum of setup times) is minimized.

In green routing, a vehicle can serve customers with large demand on a route first in order to reduce the emissions from the load on the vehicle and in green inventory control, one can reduce the delivery frequency in order to have fewer but better utilized vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. There is often a trade-off between the distance driven and the load on the vehicle. Currently, most studies compute the carbon emissions of adding load under very specific conditions, such as transport with a given vehicle under given driving conditions.

This technique was originally proposed for multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) with the aim of taking into account the whole set of instances of a chosen type of preference model, which are compatible with preference information supplied by the DM in terms of holistic preference comparisons of some alternatives. ROR results in two weak preference relations, necessary and possible, in the whole set of alternatives; the necessary weak preference relation holds if an alternative is at least as good as another one for all instances compatible with the DM’s preference information, while the possible weak preference relation holds if an alternative is at least as good as another one for at least one compatible instance. To apply ROR to decision under risk and uncertainty we reformulate this problem in terms of MCDA. This is obtained by replacing an uncertain outcome of a decision problem on a set of alternatives (e.g., a gain on investment) by a set of quantiles of the outcome distribution, which are meaningful for the DM. These quantiles become evaluation criteria of a deterministic MCDA problem, equivalent to the decision problem under risk and uncertainty.

A simple pattern of the fall of wickets would be a uniform one with wickets falling at equally spaced intervals.  However, a popular belief is that there are frequent and significant departures from this uniform pattern.   Commentators of the game frequently refer to the phenomenon of wickets ‘falling in a heap’, that is, a clustering of the fall of wickets.  An extreme case of such clustering is the phenomenon of ‘choking’ when a team in a strong position finally loses the game after wickets fall in close succession.\r\nThis study tests whether wicket clustering actually exists in cricket and if so, examines what explains the phenomenon. Failure clusters are first identified using standard algorithms and outlier tests.  The distance between failures is measured using metrics of runs scored and balls faced.  Data of the One Day Internationals played by cricket playing nations is used to do this.  Various factors that could explain the clustering phenomenon are examined, like the identity of the team, the batting order (whether the team was batting first in the game or second), the location of the cluster (whether it is at the beginning of an innings, in the middle or towards the end) and the performance pressure faced by batsmen while chasing a run rate that is significantly higher than the run rate at that instant.", :title "Wicket Clustering in Cricket", :keyword2 168, :authors (50919 47704 50920), :session 680}, 1281 {:keyword1 126, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Worldwide, more and more consumers of electrical energy are being billed using time-of-use pricing.

The company's objective is to minimize the transportation cost of agents to workplaces. In this paper we propose a model and a program for work teams setup and logistics. The proposed model is based on the generalized assignment model. The objective function minimizes the transportation cost. The first constraint ensures that each agent is assigned to a single workplace, but not all agents will be compulsorily assigned. The second constraint establishes the number of agents in every working team. The method allows finding the global optimal solution of the problem. This solution, however, has no practical interest because it mixes agents working in different sectors such as supermarkets and hospitals. Agents have different abilities and cannot be exchanged for each other. So it is better solving the problem by specific contracts or areas. The program was written in Microsoft-Excel-Solver and tested in a company providing outsourced services. All tests carried out with company’s data provide good results.

Processing speed of a job at a time depends on a temporal usage of power. This relation is expressed by an increasing and strictly concave speed function. We consider two optimization problems in which P and E denote respectively: the known limit for available power, and the available amount of energy. The first is a problem of defining a minimum level of one of the parameters P or E, under the assumption that the minimum makespan is calculated only on a basis of a known value of the other parameter (thus, these are optimization problems with only one active constraint: either on power or on energy). The second is a problem of finding a minimum level of one parameter (P or E), under an assumed value of the makespan (these are typical server problems). In the proposed approach we divide the problems into two classes: (a) when the number of jobs is not greater than the number of machines, and (b) the other ones. The former class is easier since all jobs can be processed in parallel. For the latter class, a more complex approach based on sequences of combinations of jobs has to be applied.

Because terrorists are purposeful agents, game theoretic models of terrorist-counterterrorist interactions have been suggested since then. However, the implicit assumptions of common knowledge and rational behavior of terrorists in these models have also been criticized. The consequence of this debate was the emergence of a new generation of models in which terrorists are seen as boundedly rational.

We establish that the (weak) Pareto solution/point set of a piecewise linear multicriteria program is the union of finitely many semi-closed polyhedra. This is a generalization of the well-known Arrow, Barankin and Blackwell theorem, which says that the (weak) Pareto solution/point set of a linear multicriteria program are the unions of ﬁnitely many polyhedra. We will investigate their weak sharp minimum property. We propose an algorithm for finding the Pareto point set of a continuous piecewise linear bi-criteria program and generalize it to the discontinuous case.

Biofuels from straw or wood are therefore most efficiently produced at a large-scale BTL (biomass to liquid) plant. With limited biomass resources in short distance, it can be challenging to supply the required amount of feedstock in a sustainable way. Long-distance transportation of raw biomass is limited by its low energetic density and high transportation cost. Densification processes such as chipping, pelletizing or pyrolysis can be applied to produce bioenergy carriers with increased energy content. Due to restricted truck capacities, train transportation is necessary to take full advantage of the densification effect in terms of lower transportation costs. This work investigates biomass densification in combination with multimodal transportation. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program with the objective of minimizing the total supply chain cost, including feedstock, transportation and processing cost. The model determines the optimum location of the central BTL plant and the configuration of the decentralized densification processes.

In this paper, the problems under various measures are formulated as bi-criteria optimization models in which wealth is allocated to various assets by considering the tradeoff of return and risk. In particular, we investigate the portfolio optimization models under three risk measures (including L-infinity, VaR and CVaR risk measures).

As CVaR risk measure can be formulated as a convex piecewise linear function, the model under CVaR risk measure can be solved by linear simplex algorithm. The model under VaR risk measure can be reformulated by applying the modeling of a mixed 0-1 linear multi-criteria program.

The Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) in Milwaukee wished to know whether savings could be made if an observation unit were set up as an intermediate unit between the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and the Acute Care Unit. This arose from a concern that in future, insurance companies might refuse to pay for PICU level of care if the patient could have been safely treated elsewhere. This paper describes an Excel-based analytic tool which enables clinicians to identify patients who might be eligible for treatment outside the PICU, and then estimate the financial impact of relocating them. Data mining techniques were used to identify and group the patients/disease types selected for placement outside of the PICU, as well as key resources and tasks involved in patient care and outcomes.  \r\n\r\nThe study focused on one specific reason for admission, ingestion (accidental or deliberate) of toxic substances.

A number of yet unknown genomes was successfully read giving scientists a chance to better understand life.

The most computationally complex step here is assembly, that can be perceived as integration of raw data (nucleotide strings called reads) from sequencers. Goal of the assembly is to merge input reads into sequence that is possible close to genome of an organism the reads was taken from. Main problems of assembly are repetitions in genome causing ambiguities in result. To overcome this, assembly methods provide cutoffs whenever two or more alternative results could be produced. Each method uses its own cutoff procedure but two general strategies can be distinguished. Overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) strategy treats each read as a node of a digraph. If the reads overlap, nodes are connected with an arc. Finding cutoffs in such graph is rather complex. An alternative for OLC is labeled graphs strategy that splits reads into equal-length pieces forming arcs. As sequences are held in arcs, cutoffs can be easily found.

Such a real-life graph is often non-ordered and has a random structure. This fact largely results from the need to establish direct bilateral connections between certain pairs of nodes. In many cases, such an initial structure can be rearranged and transformed into a hub & spoke structure, where each final node–a spoke–is associated only with its hub – the interchange and communication node. Hubs have direct connections with the other hubs (in the ideal case with all the other hubs–the subgraph of hubs should constitute a clique). In such a situation, the longest communication between the spoke nodes, belonging to different hubs, may be treated as a path: SPOKE_A-HUB_1(-HUB_2)-SPOKE_B, with maximum two interchanges.

Solutions for the individual single staff type problems are computed using a column generation method similar to solving strategies for the vehicle routing problem with semi-soft time windows. Thereby, new techniques to speed up the computation of negative reduced cost columns for this problem type are presented, as limited subsequence and specifically designed branching schemes. Furthermore, heuristic methods are used to obtain a set of initial solutions for the column generation approach. These heuristic procedures may also act as standalone algorithms and accurately represent dispatching methods currently in place in the real system. Hence, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the performance of the heuristic methods and results are analysed.

The operational management of multi-product pipelines is often concerned with scheduling and sizing of product batches under consideration of e.g. storage capacities or order deadlines. Commonly, such scheduling problems are modeled for a discrete number of product orders of varying size resulting in discrete scheduling problems. \r\nIn this talk a one-to-one pipeline for multiple products with constant demands per time unit is considered as it appears e.g. in chemical industry. It is shown that the optimal sequencing and scheduling of product batches can be obtained by solving an economic lot scheduling problem (ELSP) which must be adapted w.r.t. to the product separation technology of the pipeline system under study. In three case studies the application of the derived ELSP models is illustrated by solving realistically sized problem instances for different separation technologies.

The co-op purchases product from its members according to a quality-dependent price schedule. To be viable over the long-term, the price schedule must be competitive with the open market from both the perspective of the farmer and the co-op. One alternative for achieving this condition is to set prices that largely mimic the open market, and indeed, we find this approach in use at a major co-op that we studied.\r\n\r\nWe identify a simple pricing scheme that shows potential to improve performance, and we characterize the drivers and the magnitude of performance improvement. We show that improvement is largely dictated by the significance of the co-op’s brand equity—the degree to which the co-op can command a higher price for the product than a farmer. For the case of risk-averse farmers, we show how the pricing scheme can be augmented by crop insurance, and that performance improvement is greater in the presence of risk aversion.

The first extension deals with a discrete structure of uncertainty based on a set of scenarios associated with a given constraint. Despite this discrete structure, we show using dualization and LP theory that the robust counterpart of this problem is still an LP. We applied this approach to new housing location problems with choice models, where utilities of customers can follow several scenarios, but a most-likely scenario is identified.

Given the ageing population, dial-a-ride systems gain importance to complement regular transportation modes. The current practice consists in that users choose a provider to submit their request.

To provide greater flexibility and better utilization of resources, we may divide trailer routes into segments and assign the segments to resource shifts. The latter case increases the complexity due to dependency issues when segments of the same trailer route are assigned to different resource shifts. Currently, we have a software product that uses column generation, where complete trailer routes are assigned to resource shifts (columns), but this approach is not fully applicable with segments, because then the columns are no longer independent.

This creates a game with a defender strategy space which is exponential in the number of possible targets.

An attempt in this direction has been proposed by O.L.V. Costa and M.H.A. Davis. Roughly speaking, one step of their approach consists in solving an optimal stopping problem which makes this technique quite difficult to implement. Our method has the advantage of being constructive and is loosely speaking based on the iteration of a single-jump-or-intervention operator associated to an auxiliary PDMP.

The purpose of this work is to show that the  Braess Paradox can be observed in macroscopic electric networks consisting of resistors and diodes. We first identify the electrical quantities that correspond to the flow and the cost on the network and illustrate the mapping of the cost functions to ideal electrical components. By writing Kirchoff Law nodal equations for the electrical network, we illustrate how, by appropriate choice of component values, the Braess Paradox can be observed in the network. We show how the classic Braess Paradox examples can be cast into a form where they can be implemented as real electric circuits. We exploit the nodal equations to show that networks with more general link cost functions can also exhibit the Braess Paradox. We construct several macroscopic electric circuits out of real physical components and demonstrate, by making voltage measurements, that the voltage across the circuit increases as another link is added showing that the Braess Paradox can occur in real circuits.

The developed models capture the entire energy system and conversion chain, including residential, service and industrial sectors. End-use energy demand includes heat and electricity. Several scenarios are developed to assess the impacts of different technology mixes and carbon mitigation policies. The degree of DGST adoption is case-dependent and influenced by several factors, including the existing energy system, resource availability and technology access. A shift towards decentralized electricity and heating systems is observed in both the rural and urban case study, accompanied by a substantial reduction in national grid imports. Storage technologies, such as building-level heat storage, also enable notable savings, partly due to reduced investments in grid infrastructure.

To outline the prices of batches of energy is used a neural network that performs the price prediction for the next month using historical series of energy market prices and historical rainfall for the period. It is proposed a prediction quality index using the technical analysis tools bollinger bands and moving averages. The method is applied in three scenarios with the following objectives: maximizing profits, minimizing electrical losses and hydroelectric energy pricing. Using the method, it was possible to determine the expected value of the results achieved for each decision maker, which in turn, considered the use of optimal strategies against your opponents.", :title "Optimal investment planning in a competitive electricity market with distributed generation ", :keyword2 123, :authors (50673), :session 739}, 1827 {:keyword1 13, :keyword3 66, :abstract "In this talk we propose and study a novel variable metric stochastic gradient algorithm for minimizing the sum of a convex nonsmooth function and a large number of convex smooth functions.

The individual tariffs that make up the tariff structure of an electricity retailer are often characterized by different price components, i.e. the total price to be paid by a customer can depend on several variables, such as the peak energy demand or the total energy consumption over a period of time. To determine a particular customer’s tariff within the tariff structure offered, electricity retailers may use certain thresholds regarding the customer’s peak demand or energy consumption, i.e. a customer may be forced into a different tariff when its demand or consumption exceeds, or remains under, a relevant threshold. This can lead to a situation in which small changes in the energy demand or consumption of a customer may lead to a large difference in the electricity price that the customer has to pay. A customer friendly approach therefore would be to design the tariff structure such that discontinuities between tariffs are minimized.

In both cases, the criteria are grouped into two categories: critical and strategic. Then, an approach based on value function method, AHP and PROMETHEE has been applied to qualify and assess providers by considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative criteria from a group decision making perspective. The proposal allows qualifying suppliers, evaluating products from one or several suppliers, classifying and selecting the best suppliers and monitoring suppliers periodically.

In each iteration, this algorithm calculates the minimum angle formed by the current node and its neighbor found in the previous iteration with its other neighbors.

In general, we start from a node having the minimum x-coordinate. The drawback of this condition is that the boundary nodes cannot be determined in the case where it is not possible to determine the starting boundary node.

In this work, we propose a generic solution for routing, taking into account connectivity maintenance in wireless sensor networks. The solution can be used in any routing protocol. The weight of a node is defined in a way that it changes according to the percentage of the remaining energy rate, and the weight of a path is equal to the average weight of the component nodes. Once the routing path is chosen and the delivery of data has begun, the data source can change the routing path if it receives an update message from the routing path component node by comparing the new weight of the path to the weight of the checked routing paths.

This paper presents a continuous-time, genetic algorithm-based model to optimise medium-term capacity plans for a multi-product biopharmaceutical facility. In the algorithm, each chromosome consists of dynamic length vectors containing product labels and batch numbers for each product generated at random, which are later evolved using genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation. The solutions to the optimisation problem are built as ordered dynamic lists of product campaigns using the aforementioned vectors. Using the proposed model each key stage of a product campaign, such as the beginning of a campaign, first harvest, first batch and last batch, can be accurately scheduled. The model accounts for product campaign changeovers, campaign delays, and product approval times. Additionally, there is a penalty-free method for handling a constraint of meeting the specified demand on time, i.e., when late deliveries are not accepted.

In contrast to other care institutions, clients receiving services stay at their own homes. Hence, the home care providers face a complex routing and scheduling task to plan their services. For application in practice, skill requirements and legal labor regulations must be considered. Most publications in literature consider a static planning for a given set of clients and nurses. However, regular changes in demands of clients and availability of nurses occur and lead to a dynamic setting. Therefore, we propose a heuristic solution approach to incorporate these changes in a rolling planning horizon while preserving continuity between planning periods. The consideration of continuity avoids changes in assignments of nurses to clients and aims at preserving similar time schedules. Both aspects are essential for client satisfaction and need to be joined with the economical objective function of minimizing travel times. We use our numerical results for several analyses to show the computational efficiency of the proposed method and quality of the solutions.

This is particularly important when the market is being tested in order to get knowledge about the potential demand.\r\nThe framework is that of a traditional Newsvendor problem where decisions will generate expected under- and over-capacity costs, which are function of both capacity investment and transportation cost (which in turn depends on the facilities location). What distinguishes this work from other inventory-location problems is that, in our case, the \"critical fractile\" is not uniform across facilities.

Different from classical depot-to-depot type route construction in the literature, our routes are initialized at certain customers, so called route centers, and they are extended by visiting further customers before and after already visited ones. Here, a route center corresponds to a used vehicles, and a clique in the customer incompatibility graph gives us initial route centers. A complete routing plan, i.e. an integer solution to the master LP model, is obtained by making two type of decisions; customer grouping and introducing a new vehicle. These decisions are made by examining solution properties of the dual our master LP model. We also give a dual interpretation of the master LP model by using the primal-dual method as a base for our decision system. An important feature of our algorithm is that every used vehicle has a fixed-size route set in the master LP model which makes our algorithm to halt in constant time.

A pairing is a crew path starting at a base covering many flights during few days of works and finishing at the same base. For large-scale problems a first difficulty is the exponential number of feasible pairing (number of variables). Columns generation permits to deal with it. However solving a master problem of 40 000 constraints at each of the thousands iterations of the column generation request to much time. To reduce the solution time some airlines use a Rolling-Horizon heuristic (RH) that divides the horizon into overlapping time slices. For example two days slices with an overlap of one day. However solving 30 problems of 3000 flights (two days time slices) requires many days and the quality of solutions in not so good because the optimisation is too myopic (the windows are narrow). The Dynamic Constraints Aggregation method (DCA) developed by (Elhallaoui et al. 2005) speed-up the master problem by reducing the degeneracy. This method also produces better dual variables and reduces the number of column generation iterations. Furthermore the LP solution is less fractional and it reduces the number of nodes to explore in the branch and bound. This permits to solve a weekly window of 10 000 flights in few hours. The RH with weekly windows produces solution improved by up to 5% on salaries and reduces the number of deadheads by up to 40%.

This method requires the repeated solution of quadratic programs for different parameter values, and it may imply a large computational cost, especially in a setting of multi-class SVMs and large training datasets. For multi-class classification problems, in the presence of different misclassification costs, identifying a desirable set of values for these parameters becomes even more relevant.

Nevertheless the traffic coordination problems are mixed continuous-discrete ones with many local optimal solutions. Our approach is general and usable in any traffic conditions up to saturation based on a group model of traffic flow without specific assumptions.

The limited volume of environmental water is often insufficient to meet the demands of all species and ecological processes associated with the river. Moreover, species may have conflicting flow demands. For example, a constant low flow may be required to provide habitat for macro-invertebrates, whereas high flows may be needed to stimulate spawning of a fish species in the same season. Thus, complex trade-off decisions are required around timing, volume and location of environmental water releases to achieve best environmental benefit. These decisions become more complex under the uncertainty of future climate. In this research we model this problem as a Stochastic Mixed Integer Program.

This leads to the fact that simpler measures in terms of their complexity should be used or some other techniques should be designed. We propose another approach on how to detect central elements in complex networks. Instead of calculating centrality measures with a high computational complexity on complex networks, we can apply them on its smaller analogues. If the sets of central nodes in small and complex networks are similar, some centrality measures with a high computational complexity can applied to complex networks. Thus, we consider different existing centrality measures as well as some rules from social choice theory based on majority relation (uncovered sets, untrapped sets, etc.) and different network elimination techniques.

The motivation for analyzing this kind of model is a real-world multiprocessor scheduling problem, in which we seek to shape the utilization profile of discretely divisible resources in a right-skewed fashion, that is, preferring higher utilization in earlier time periods.\r\n\r\nThe methodological core of our contribution is the proposal, comparison and analysis of lower bounding schemes for the considered bin packing problem. First, we present adaptations of bounds L2 (Martello and Toth, 1990) and L3 (Labbe et al., 1991) for the linear usage cost objective. Second, we devise two new lower bounds, one based on a relaxation of a bin covering problem and the other one based on a multiple choice knapsack problem.

When these properties are present, the decision problem becomes easy in the sense that many methods (simple and complex) yield the same decision, eliminating the need to find an optimal trade-off between the various cues that are available. For instance, a single cue, or a simple tallying of the cues, may suffice to make the correct decision. \r\n\r\nI will review statistical properties of the decision environments that make the decision problem easy. I will then examine how often we encounter these properties in a large, diverse collection of natural environments.

In the non-resumable case a task started but not finished before a non-availability interval must be repeated when the machine becomes available again.

An industrial robot performs the transportation of the parts between the machines and the loading/unloading of the machines. If the robotic cell produces different types of parts, we refer to it as a multiple part-type cell (in contrast to single part-type cells), in which parts have different processing times on the machines. We consider the cyclic scheduling of the robot moves. A cycle is specified by a repeatable sequence of robot moves designed to transfer a set of parts between the machines for their processing. A cycle in which k parts are produced is called a k-unit cycle. In other words, the robot takes k parts from the input device and whenever all the robot activities are repeated exactly k times and the robot returns to its initial state of the cycle, the k-unit cycle is completed. Exactly k parts are produced at the end of the cycle. On the other hand, Concatenated Robot Move Sequences (CRM sequences) is the repetition of the same 1-unit cycle repeated k times to produce k parts. The objective in both cases is to determine the optimal robot move cycle (either 1-unit or k-unit) and the part sequence to maximize the long-run average throughput rate. We develop a mixed integer programming formulation and heuristic algorithms for both cases.

Classification and regression tree analysis was used on historical data to determine significant differences in length of stay variables for adult and pediatric patient pods and determine ideal workload distribution. Optimization was then used to match the required ideal staffing level to patient demand. The new staffing level was implemented starting fourth quarter in the year 2015 in a large academic medical center.

To alleviate this problem, various parametric methods have been developed. Our work elaborates the ranked nodes method (RNM) that is used for constructing CPTs for BNs consisting of a class of nodes called ranked nodes. Such nodes typically represent continuous quantities that lack well-established interval scales and are hence expressed by ordinal scales. In addition, RNM is also commonly applied to nodes that are expressed by interval scales. However, the use of RNM in this way may be ineffective due to challenges which are not addressed in the existing literature but are brought up by us.

In a more complicated model, the lender makes two decisions. The first is how much, if anything, the initial investment should be. The second decision is made in the event that the other lenders have not offered a sufficient amount of money to match the required loan amount. In that case, the question for the lender is whether to increase their investment so that the loan is fully funded.

It is difficult to construct (optimal) classifiers considering exponentially many possible rules. To overcome this difficulty, the author has proposed a kernel trick approach, which deals with all possible rules based on the kernel method and Boolean functions. A feature space of the proposed kernel is given by the set of (pseudo-)Boolean functions whose domain is the family of rules. Each object is mapped to a Boolean function, whose truth values are the rules satisfied by the object. We use Boolean functions to provide weights on rules, which introduce heuristics of rule generation, such as excluding inconsistent rules. Then, we calculate the inner product of feature vectors of objects with the provided weight function, and obtain a Boolean function kernel. Using the Boolean function kernel, we can implicitly obtain a rule-based classifier.

Though, quantities resulting from recycling processes are still uncertain and therefore, demand cannot be met by this secondary source alone and the primary mining source is still needed. Nevertheless, having a second supply source in place enables manufacturers to reduce supply risks and increase sustainability in comparison to single sourcing.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we investigate a dual sourcing strategy where strategic materials can be procured from a primary raw materials supplier and from a secondary recycling source, hence taking into account new and recycled materials simultaneously. Considering uncertain prices for recycled materials, uncertain recycling quantities and uncertain demand as well as their potential dependencies we develop a single period inventory model. We derive the order quantities for recycled and primary materials, the related costs and evaluate the effectiveness of a dual sourcing strategy.", :title "Sustainable dual sourcing of strategic raw materials by integrating recycled materials", :keyword2 101, :authors (37248 46997 2391), :session 529}, 2252 {:keyword1 45, :keyword3 150, :abstract "In this study we address an integration of interrelated optimization problems for home health care: rostering, assignment, routing, and scheduling in multi-period workforce planning under uncertainty in nurse availability.

Two nested genetic algorithms are integrated. Steady-state reproduction is carried out based on two replacement strategies: replacing solutions at random and replacing the worst solutions. Experiments are conducted on instances based on real historical data from a company operating in Lugano, Switzerland. The obtained results show that, in genetic algorithm, the strategy of replacing the worst solutions outperforms the strategy of replacing solutions at random in our case. Addressing the four optimization problems in a unified approach results in a more efficient solution.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for operations both in military and civilian usage. The major interest fields in designing UAVs are interoperability, reliability, autonomy, engine systems and payload. Path planning is directly related with these fields; hence it has prime importance for UAVs. In this work, the defined UAV path planning problem is based on multi-Travelling Salesman Problem (m-TSP). In m-TSP, the \"n\" number of target nodes should be visited only one time by \"m\" number of vehicles and the vehicles should return to the same starting node. The objective function of m-TSP is to find the subtours for all UAVs that the total travelling cost is minimized. Additionally in the solved problem, the number of UAVs is also minimized simultaneously. m-TSP is an NP-hard problem, therefore a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is generated to solve the path planning problem with minimum number of UAVs. The flying ranges of the UAVs are also used as constraints. The designed GA has problem specific representation and operators. Seven different problem sets are selected from literature. The number of target nodes is varying from 22 to 150 and the flying ranges of the UAVs are differentiated from 50 to 2500 unit distances.

In the VRPCD, it is assumed that a truck undergoes consolidation operations as soon as it arrives at the cross-dock.

The discovery of subsets of inflammatory and resident monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells opened new perspectives on the role of inflammation and immune responses in atherosclerosis. Assuming that the disease state, like hyperlipidemia is a displacement from homeostasis, inflammation is the tissue response for restoring homeostasis. It should be emphasized that monocyte-macrophage axis is central to atherogenesis process because it regulates cholesterol traffic and inflammation state in the arterial wall. According to various microenvironmental signals, the differentiation from monocytes sub-populations into macrophages occurs in concomitance with the acquisition of a functional phenotype (M1 or M2). M1 and M2 macrophages play opposite roles during inflammation, but both are present in atherosclerotic lesions. These mentioned phenomena are particularly important because they regulate vascular homeostasis, whose disruption appears to be the key issue for sustaining atherogenesis.

The aim is to maximize the social responsibilities of the network by increasing the number of job opportunities created from manufacturing and transportation as well as decreasing the amount of food wastes caused by manufacturing sites. The Food supply chain is one example where we observe more and more attention to sustainability during the last years in different regions (Europe, North America and Asia) within the production and distribution operations. This sector consumes a lot of energy, especially for products that need to be conserved for a certain time such as Fast Moving Consumers Goods and frozen foods. Therefore, a case study of a North American Frozen Food industry is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. The key contribution of this work is to support managers to  analyse and plan \"sustainable\" supply chains, and to evaluate the supply performance based on total cost, GHG emissions, and delivery efficiency.

However, in the race for faster algorithms and better solutions, few research has been performed to shed light on the problem itself. Even though problem-specific knowledge is an important ingredient in the design of heuristics, such knowledge is rare for the VRP. As an example, it is proven that in the Traveling Salesman Problem does no optimal solution contain intersecting edges. Even though such a statement is not true for the VRP, it should be possible to deduct general guidelines such as: ”In general, solutions can be improved by removing intersections”.\r\nIn this presentations, we take a first step in this direction and use data mining techniques to identify properties that distinguish optimal from non-optimal solutions. Those properties describe the geometrical nature and relations of routes. We combine them with instance characteristics to derive findings that are independent of the specific problem instance. With the help of a classification learner we are able to predict with a relatively high percentage from the defined properties whether a certain solution for any instance is optimal or not.\r\nMoreover, we extract rules that explain why a solution is not optimal.

The processing time of each vessel depends on the number of cranes assigned to it, and there are several costs related to waiting and delay times, and the deviation from the desired position at the quay. The objective is to determine for each vessel the number of cranes assigned to it and its berthing time and position, in order to minimize the total assignment cost of all the vessels in the planning horizon.\r\n\r\nWe propose a new Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) and we include a Local Search to obtain good solutions in short computing times.

We focus in this study on the manufacturing of a set of vias that connect components from two consecutive layers. One of the basic steps in this process is Lithography. Lithography imposes a certain minimum distance for two vias to be printed simultaneously. Hence dense layouts are decomposed into feasible sub layouts (a.k.a. masks) that are printed sequentially to produce the original arrangement: this is called Multiple Patterning (MP). Each lithography step is costly and the goal is thus to minimize the number of masks in this decomposition. This problem can readily be modeled as a standard graph coloring problem in unit disk graphs (a NP-hard problem). Directed self-assembly (DSA) is a promising solution to reduce further the number of masks. The idea is to group vias that have to be assigned to different masks in MP to a same mask combining DSA and Lithography. The main challenge of our study is to find the best way of grouping vias (following imposed rules) in order to minimize the number of ‘hybrid’ masks.

A widely used benchmark for measuring the efficiency of NPOs is the overhead cost ratio, consisting of the total money spent on administration and fundraising relative to the budget. Such easily accessible measurements face severecriticism, since variations of overhead costs are not necessarily linked to changes in the impact achieved. Additionally, the focus on such information can lead to increasing pressure to reduce expenses, with potential negative effects on administrative capacities. Unlike fundraising expenses, administrative costs do not help advertise the actions of an NPO. Reducing administrative expenses is a logical consequence from a financial viewpoint and might, hence, not only negatively affect NPOs but also beneficiaries. This work provides an analytical framework for analyzing NPO decision making concerning administrative costs. The paper provides answers to important recent research questions on the optimal level of administrative spending, the influencing factors and the effects of available information on NPOs and beneficiaries. The results show, that administrative expenditures do not necessarily reduce utility created, but their  effect depends on a variety of factors including the amount of financial information, the impact on the efficiency of increased administrative spending and the structure of donations.", :title "Funds allocation in NPOs: The role of administrative cost ratios", :keyword2 0, :authors (30924 42654 31749), :session 184}, 2507 {:keyword1 157, :keyword3 77, :abstract "In the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), all vehicles are required to return to the depot after visiting a set of customers.

It tackles, at the strategic level, the design of a distribution network which consists of a set of available suppliers, multiple potential distribution centers and a set of demand zones. At design time, daily uncertain demand is issued from demand zones and the opened distribution centers must be supplied given an uncertain lead-time. The demand uncertainty is modeled with a nonstationary distribution with seasonal trend and the lead-time uncertainty is modeled with a known distribution. Considering that, a scenario-based approach is used to model the demand and lead-time uncertainty in a two-stage setting. Moreover, a daily reorder point (r, Q) inventory control policy at the distribution centers is considered. With these features, a stochastic two-stage mathematical model integrating the inventory control decisions with location-allocation design decisions is proposed.

The method generates a set of vectors and the associated probability weights that match a given target mean vector and a target covariance matrix exactly. A crucial difference between existing moment matching methods and the new method is that, the algorithm generates a unimodal distribution with the mode coinciding with the mean. The probability weights of the sample vectors in the new method decrease as the vectors move ‘further’ away from the mean in terms of the inner product, whereas the existing moment matching methods generate sample vectors with equal probability weights. Additional ‘free’ parameters in the algorithm can be used to match higher order moments approximately. We demonstrate the use of this method for probabilistic assessment of small-disturbance stability of an indeterminate power system. The presence of uncertainty in operating conditions and parameters results in variations in the damping of critical modes and makes probabilistic assessment of system stability necessary.

All that data is kept in sophisticated data structures organized accordingly to the way we designed the ETL control flows, and structured following the requirements of the ETL tasks.

This ability is quite relevant when we have small ETL opportunity windows – the time we have to populate a data warehouse – constraining the entire ETL process in terms of processing time and recovering. The method presented and discussed in this work attenuates effectively the effect of an ETL failure, giving a second chance to the ETL system to refresh the data warehouse and therefore to keep updated the information that decision makers use on their daily business activities.

This paper presents a concept of a just-in-time job shop scheduling problem. A just-in-time criterion of a schedule is a total measure of time deviation between the particular job scheduled time and the planned time for that job to be finished. Two main criteria of this deviation are: job earliness and job tardiness. Besides these, several other criteria can be derived: e.g. total, average or weighted sum of earliness and tardiness, mean average deviation, average square deviation, and total costs of tardiness and earliness with cost of work in progress. For the practical experiment, an example of job shop problem with just-in-time criteria function was developed in the MiniZinc modelling language.

One of main issues in the debate over trade, pollution and the environment is how best to capture the interactions of environment and trade measurement for sustainable development.

Existing studies have shown that the structure of environmental regulations should be modified to reflect the existence of trade liberalization and the achievement of UN’s sustainable development goals. Therefore, further research on the interaction between trade theory and environmental regulation is needed. \r\nThis paper studies the potential relationship between environmental quality and trade liberalization. It is assumed that trading countries behave as oligopolists but their costs depend on the level of the global environment. The environmental quality then can be modelled in such a way as: (i) a given stock which is damaged by a flow of pollution and (ii) a renewable resource which is used.

The goal of SPQP is to ensure the right number of extra (spare, service) parts at the right place (where the broken part is) at the right time. SPQP may be analyzed in the context of repairable or non-repairable service parts. Here, we focus on the second case. In the literature, spare parts optimization is regarded as a stochastic problem since the demand for extra parts is treated as a random variable with a known distribution. Hence, the optimal stock quantity  minimizes the expected loss resulting from buying a given number of parts before potential failures. However, in the author’s opinion, SPQP may also be a strategic problem, i.e. an uncertain problem with unknown probabilities. Such a situation occurs e.g. for totally new devices with no historical data about previous failures. Therefore, we present a novel approach, based on a hybrid of Hurwicz and Bayes decision rules. It takes into account the decision maker’s attitude towards risk (measured by coefficients of optimism and pessimism) and the dispersion (asymmetry, range, frequency of extreme values) of losses connected with particular stock quantities.

Some consider the probability of route duration exceeding the threshold of the engineer’s workload while others set restrictions on the probability of individual time window constraints being violated. Their objectives are related to traditional routing costs whilst we take a different approach. We define the risk of missing a task as the probability that an engineer’s arrival time to a customer site is later than the time window. We seek to minimise the risks given a certain amount of resources.  Each task has an uncertain duration following a known normal distribution. However the distribution of arrival time to a customer site will not be normally distributed because of the time window constraints.

The firm decides to use a preorder policy in which the customers should place their order before their actual need based on a predetermined time window which is called committed lead time. Consequently, the firm has to pay them a discount according to the length of the committed lead time. We characterize the optimal length of the committed lead time and its corresponding base-stock level such that a long-run average cost function consisting of holding cost, penalty cost and committed lead time cost is minimized. Based on the parameters of the problem, we find a threshold for discount unit price. When discount unit price is less than the threshold, then the optimal production strategy is a make-to-order strategy (the optimal committed lead time is equal to production lead time and the optimal base stock level is zero) and when discount unit price is more than  the threshold, the optimal production strategy is a make-to-stock strategy (the optimal committed lead time is zero and optimal base stock level is non-zero).

Different from the CSPUL, in this work, retails in stock in addition to being used, they can be sold to companies, which use them as raw material.

The problem addresses the optimal placement of n facilities given a set of n locations, and a set of flows between facilities. The solution of the QAP is to minimize total assignment cost; that is, the sum of the flows between facilities multiplied by the corresponding distances between the locations. When additional quadratically related objectives (e.g., operational and travel expenses) are created, the problem becomes a multi-objective QAP (mQAP). The systems which can be modelled by QAPs or mQAPs are numerous and complex (e.g., system scheduling, traffic flow analysis, and VLSI synthesis), with results which are important to both research and industry. Several methods for obtaining exact solutions of QAPs, which are generally applied to small problems (n < 30), have been outlined by Burkard. As solution spaces increase in size, exact solution methods are no longer feasible due to memory and computational time constraints; thus, heuristics are needed. Historically, genetic algorithms have been discounted from the set of possible heuristics in favour of other methods despite showing comparable results. However, it has been hypothesized that with more sophisticated reproduction or mutation schemes, a further gain in the performance of evolutionary algorithms applied to QAPs may be achieved.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present a new type of mQAP based on a military training problem with three quadratic assignment objectives and one linear assignment objective. The quadratically related objective analogous to the traditional QAP is the travel cost, where distances are computed between trainee and device locations (represented here by travel costs), while flows represent the number of trainees traveling to a device location. Moreover, training time and training cost depend on the type of device used for a given task training. However, training devices of different types have different capacities; that is, the number of trainees who can train at the same time. Depending on the combination of training devices chosen for completion of a task by all trainees, we obtain a variable “flow” of trainees through devices of each type. The capital cost (associated with acquiring a new device) is a linear assignment objective. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we explicitly formulate the Training Device Estimation (TraDE) model as an mQAP which more clearly contextualizes the novelty and usefulness of the proposed mixing mutation operator. We use TraDE to explore mutation and cross-over operator combinations for multi-objective genetic algorithms for the use in mQAPs. In genetic algorithms, mutation and crossover operators are usually applied to a parent population in order to generate a child population. These mutations are applied in the form of random variations to chromosomes at a given mutation probability. The standard mutation operator is applied to the entire chromosome of a population member. \r\n\r\nIn our mQAP, each population member is described by a two-part multi-dimensional chromosome which defines the requirements of a specific training task by representing the device and location assignments for all trainees. Each solution is a multi-chromosome composed of numerous two-part genes (as many as there tasks). The first part corresponds to training device assignments and the second to device locations. The objective functions are based on the sum of the device assignments for all tasks. The standard mutation operator is not sufficient for our mQAP because the individual gene parts, although dependent, need to be treated independently in order to more efficiently explore the problem solution space. \r\n\r\nWe propose a modification to the standard mutation operator, the mixing mutation operator, where each part of a chromosome mutated concurrently with a standard operator, will now be mutated asynchronously. That is, for a population member represented by a multidimensional multi-chromosome (in this case a two-dimensional multi-chromosome), one of the dimensions will be chosen (with equal probability) and mutated. Our mixing mutation operator differs from previous operators on multi-chromosomes given that it mutates many more than one gene per chromosome and only mutates genes along a single direction (either trainee device assignments or device locations). One-dimensional multi-chromosomes have also been used for military fleet sizing problems where a standard mutation operator was used. Mixing mutation forces the exploration of a larger set of possible solutions for any problem which is formulated using a multidimensional chromosomes (whether or not they are multi-chromosomes). \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we propose a principled comparison between the standard and mixing mutation operators with and without the crossover operator. The comparison is carried out on a test problem in which all optimal solutions are known in order to better assess algorithm convergence (the initial problem addressed with the TraDE model was focused on a real world scenario where an exhaustive search was not possible). \r\n\r\nWe show that with the addition of a more sophisticated mutation operator, the rate of convergence of NSGA II to the Pareto front for the TraDE model, an mQAP, and the extent of Pareto front coverage was greatly increased. Additionally, the implementation of the mixing mutation operator in conjunction with a crossover operator yields an impressive average coverage rate of approximately 95% (as compared to 80% for the standard mutation/crossover combination) after 5,000 generations. The number of solutions which are discovered when the mixing operator without crossover is used is double the number of solutions which are discovered by the standard operator without crossover.\r\n\r\nMoreover, combining mixing mutation with the standard crossover operator also yields results which are more consistent due to a lower standard deviation of the number of solutions in the non-dominated front. That is, the method does not only converge to a larger average number of solutions, it also converges with the lowest standard deviation between results. Thus, our study has demonstrated that when using the mixing mutation operator with NSGA II, an mQAP can be solved very effectively and efficiently.\r\n", :title "Solving a Military Training Problem as a Multiobjective Quadratic Assignment Problem", :keyword2 59, :authors (51810 51811 51812), :session 281}, 2907 {:keyword1 174, :keyword3 22, :abstract "The current study proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model to air travel for humanitarian logistics in natural disasters.

While the central body in such organisations faces asymmetry of information concerning the operating costs of the units, it may wish to incentivise them through benchmarking and target setting to operate as efficiently as possible. Considering standard DEA for this purpose, each operating unit could estimate its own individual targets. However, this decentralized scenario is not desirable for a centralised scenario in which a central body wishes to optimise the performance of the system of units as a whole. On the other hand, a uniform set of targets is often not suitable as they would be either too demanding for many units or too undemanding for others. This paper therefore proposes a DEA-based approach for incentivizing the units of a centrally managed organisation under different degrees of centralisation. The units are clustered in such a manner that they are incentivised to gain further in efficiency, seeking to optimise the performance of the units of each cluster collectively while at the same time the targets are not too demanding for inefficient units.

While slow mode deliveries can only be used every other period, with a volume to be fixed for a long-term horizon, e.g., one year, fast mode deliveries can be used every period and are flexible in the volume.

The comparison of the approximation sets obtained by both algorithms shows that the solutions generated by the MA are much better than the solutions generated by NSGA-II.

Driving behaviors are described in an inhomogeneous Markov process. We use real EV usage data from a field test with about 30 EV with three recorded EV states (driving, charging and only parking) for 6 months. EV driving patterns are simulated to consider uncertainties in EV charging availability. Simulated EV driving data from the Markov process is used in a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize EV charging schedules. Battery and inverter characteristics such as minimum charging power and non-linear charging pattern are also considered. The optimization is conducted from a system operator’s view and also considers dynamic electricity tariffs. With the uncertainty of arrival and leaving time and the required energy demand, our approach will not lead to a global optimum.  So a global optimum is given for a perfect foresight scenario as a benchmark. Both results and the underlying reasons for differences are discussed comprehensively.

While the mathematical model may look straightforward, in practice, risk analysis is a very complicated process that includes making decisions based on uncertain events. An exact risk analysis is, in general, not possible due to the large number of the parameters in the model. We use Monte-Carlo simulation to perform risk analysis in a bowtie model. For different probability distributions of event's causes and different severities of consequences in the model we perform all computations and produce different outcomes of risk assessment values.

In a second step, time is introduced in order to generate a more realistic result. The problem now involves nonlinear terms. Introducing a new vector, the model is transformed to an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model using the big-M modelling method.

This paper demonstrates that an adaptive robust UC in which, by considering wind dispatch flexibility, the second-stage problem, usually being non-convex, can be represented with an equivalent linear program (LP). Consequently, the full two-stage robust UC formulation, which is typically a bi-level problem, can be translated into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer program. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus test system show that the computation time, and the number of scenarios and violations can be significantly reduced in the unified stochastic and robust approach compared to a pure stochastic approach.

Traffic jams on highways, however, decrease drastically outside the rush hour, while the secondary roads suffer all day long, with a peak at noon.

We model this kind of traffic jam and calculate the average time that a normal vehicle needs to pass through a piece of road where they may encounter one or more slow vehicles. We consider a road where both normal and slow vehicles arrive according to  Poisson processes. When a normal vehicle encounters a slow vehicle, it has to adapt its speed during a certain period of time.

In addition, a preprocessing step is proposed to decompose the problem into smaller MILPs considering convex separation of data from different classes. In order to assign data points to classes in the testing phase of classification, we evaluated two approaches, based on the convex hulls of subsets formed and the regions defined by the hyperplanes.

We collect the text content from the online social media over a time period. This time period is divided into smaller time slices of equal duration. Then we analyze the content qualitatively in two ways: (1) we look at each time slice and collect the contents posted in that time slice, and (2) we collect all the content with respect to each user over the entire time period. The qualitative analysis is the analysis of the content with respect to abstraction and expression. Abstraction refers to objective assertions about the topic or issue in question, while expression refers to communication of user’s subjective feeling or emotion in that situation. Our main objective of looking this in two ways is to see if there are any pattern that we can find between the individual behavior and the group behavior in a social phenomena. The qualitative study of social synchrony is useful in many areas, for example, in identifying the suitable time slices and the suitable contents for viral marketing and identifying unethical behaviour in online MOOCs.

Various assumptions are made in the forecasting model. While the results are released randomly it is not clear how the bias of how results are released would affect the predictions.

Additionally, it is often necessary to adapt the algorithm again whenever the problem formulation changes. This task is laborious, not trivial and often relies on the user’s expertise. In order to overcome those drawbacks, several approaches for automating the design of MHs have been proposed. Among them, Hyper-Heuristic (HH) seeks to automatically select or generate suitable low-level heuristics (e.g. MH components, problem-specific heuristics) for effectively finding good solutions. Particularly, Lot Sizing Problems (LSP) can profit from the use of a HH approach. Besides the great amount of heuristics of different kinds developed for the different variants of LSP, changes in the planning requirements might imply in changes on the problem formulation (e.g. production levels, allowance of backlog/overtime, time window restrictions). Therefore, this work aims at increasing the generalization algorithm abilities by conceiving a hyper-heuristic approach for LSP, as it can (i) reduce dependencies on users and (ii) automatically tailor the methods to distinct variants of the problem.", :title "Automated Design of Heuristic-Based Solution Approaches for Lot-Sizing Problems", :keyword2 75, :authors (51849 26398), :session 876}, 3147 {:keyword1 101, :keyword3 100, :abstract "This contribution presents a novel optimization model to manage an industrial logistic chain responsible for wastes recovery.

The aim of the model is to minimize the daily transportation costs and associated costs of different storage facilities from where fruits are supplied to the plant in order to meet the demand. The model considers plant processing capacity, fruit demand, number and type of trucks available and the inventory of fruit in each type of storage facilities. Finally, the model was applied to a real case study of a processing plant located in the O'Higgins Region (Chile), where reported savings only in transport costs reached about 16 percent.", :title "Stochastic contribution to the Fruit Supply Chain planning", :keyword2 99, :authors (243 32792 32925 12838 32775), :session 280}, 3179 {:keyword1 18, :keyword3 171, :abstract "Seaport management and shipping are key maritime activities which increased their importance due to sustaining and maintaining the rapid growth of international trade.

At the start, the algorithm is given a set of T linearly ordered points (e.g., on the real line). Then, over the course of T trials, the nature picks a new (as of yet unlabeled) point and the algorithm predicts a label from [0,1] for that point. Then, the true label (also from [0,1]) is revealed, and the algorithm suffers the squared error loss. After T rounds, the algorithm is evaluated by the regret, which is its total squared loss compared against the best isotonic (non-decreasing) function in hindsight. We survey several standard online learning algorithms and show that none of them achieve the optimal regret exponent; in fact, most of them (including Online Gradient Descent, Follow the Leader and Exponential Weights) incur linear regret. We then prove that the Exponential Weights algorithm played over a covering net of isotonic functions has regret is bounded by O(T^{1/3}) log^{2/3}(T)) and present a matching \\Omega(T^{1/3}) \r\nlower bound on regret.

This increased focus on fuel consumption, has illuminated the huge impacts of operational disruptions in liner shipping on both costs and delayed cargo. Disruptions can occur due to adverse weather conditions, port contingencies, and many other issues.

Such a problem appears in computer systems with variable speed processors, where the current rate of program execution depends on the amount of power supplied to the processor. This problem was extensively analyzed in the literature, since methodology for solving it can be used for other problems after minor modification. The exact algorithm is computationally expensive.

Therefore, we consider the problem of optimally tracking the returns of the 1/N portfolio by selecting a small subset of the N stocks and by determining each selected stock's weight in the tracking portfolio.

All models were implemented in a multi-stage validation and verification process that resulted in custom-built software ready to use by the end users and decision makers.", :title "A Novel Framework of Simulation and Optimisation for Offshore Wind Farm Installation Logistics at SSE and SPR", :keyword2 157, :authors (2630 42829 32168 41366 42834 42835), :session 744}, 3344 {:keyword1 178, :keyword3 157, :abstract "Logistics costs constitute a major cost driver in today's economy and efficient planning of transportation processes is an important necessity for companies of all sizes and industries. We introduce a new model for tactical planning of freight transportation, capturing all important aspects of this logistical task: the routes of commodities within the network, the corresponding tariff choices as well as delivery frequencies and inventory levels. These different decisions are integrated into a unified capacitated network design formulation using a cyclic network expansion and a set of graph-based gadgets for realistically modelling the different classes of transportation tariffs occurring in practice. We complement our model by providing various algorithmic methods for solving the resulting optimization problem, most notably a local search procedure based on flow decomposition and an aggregated mixed integer programming formulation. \r\nThese results are the outcome of a joint research project of TU Berlin and 4flow AG, a leading provider of supply chain consulting, software, and fourth-party logistics services. Throughout development, the model and the algorithms have been constantly evaluated on a broad set of instances obtained from recent and ongoing customer projects of 4flow AG.

Philae is fitted with ten instruments to conduct the experiments elaborated by as many research teams across Europe. These experiments, should they be imaging, sampling or other types of signal analysis, correspond to sequences of activities constrained by two extremely scarce resources: the energy supplied by a single battery, and the storage memory of its CPU.\r\nThe CNES, the French space agency that was in charge of designing the plans executed by Philae, acquired to that purpose from an industrial subcontractor a toolkit called MOST (Mission Operation Scheduling Tool). This toolkit modeled the problem of scheduling Philae’s experiments as a complex Resource-constrained project scheduling problem using a commercial software embedding dedicated scheduling, constraint programming and operations research techniques. Limitations of this first version were identified  as the solution procedure was way too slow for large scale scenarios.\r\nWe thus present our contributions to solving the problem of scheduling Philae's activities. In particular, we focus on the design of polynomial-time complexity algorithms for efficiently reasoning about data transfers within Philae and between Philae and Rosetta. These algorithms made it possible to solve in a few seconds long term sequences of activities that otherwise required hours with the previous approach, or in some case could not be solved. Moreover, they also give a more accurate prediction of the memory usage, thus giving better guarantees against data loss.\r\nMoreover, as Philae  bounced right after touch down due to a malfunction of its harpoons, recourse schedules had to be rebuilt in a nearly real-time basis, which was made possible by the reactivity of the new algorithms.

Over decades, gas transport had been more or less steady state with long-term delivery contracts and weather forecast predictable demands. Now, demand and supply change on a daily basis and are triggered by market prices, not by security of supply. Nevertheless, a TSO like OGE has to guarantee the latter, having only little influence on the trading process. These facts result in enormously challenging problems simultaneously including uncertainties, dynamical aspects, and feasibility questions. Mathematically, these problems lead to stochastic mixed-integer non-linear non-convex optimization problems including PDE and ODE constraints.\r\nThe research part of the project run until 2015 and and it was necessary to bring together expertise in mixed-integer programming, non-linear programming, mixed-integer non-linear programming, stochastics, simulation, gas physics, network planning, law and regulations. The project involved about 40 people from OGE, five universities, and two research institutes. The whole team developed new mathematical models and methods, provided new theoretical insights into this kind of problems that lead to a completely new methodology for validating booked capacities, a task at the core of OGE's business operations. This cutting edge research was turned into a software system, bringing it directly into the workplace of the company. This software is now maintained and further developed by two university spin-offs working closely together with OGE's IT-department.\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, the ForNe project was for the first time able to solve real-world mixed-integer non-linear non-convex optimization problems with tens of thousands of binary and continuous variables.
