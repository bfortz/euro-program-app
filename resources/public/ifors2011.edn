In our research we have developed a planning approach which differs from other OR-based planning approaches in two aspects. The approach is based on integrated models and it is based on the pragmatic planning paradigm to optimally modify an existing schedule. For this purpose, the planner has to identify mandatory and optional flights. Then the planning goal is to identify the best combination of optional flights to be included into the schedule.

We find that the supplier's 'information advantage' persists in the initial phase of the repeated game. However, as the game goes on, such an information advantage gradually dissipates, and the supplier starts to randomize between accept and reject the contract.  Therefore, his private information is revealed in a probabilistic fashion.

He had broad ranging interests and always believed in the essential unity of pure and applied mathematics. Over the years, he moved comfortably between abstract generalizations of classical convexity, practical algorithms for computationally complex problems in data analysis and telecommunications and various topics in between. Despite his great achievements, he was a humble and courteous man, always generous with his time and ideas. He was an exemplary supervisor, having about 45 graduate students altogether in his long career.\r\n\r\nAlex was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) to Moisei Solomonovich Rubinov, a Professor of Economics at Leningrad Economics Institute, and Elza Abramovna Rubinova (née Okoun), an accountant. He spent the war years in Pskov, some 300 km to the south, thus escaping the siege of Leningrad. They returned after the war and Alex enrolled at Leningrad State University, beginning his Ph.D. under the supervision of Gleb Akilov. When Akilov moved to the newly-organized Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Academgorodok near Novosibirsk in 1963, Alex moved with him. Akilov had been invited there by famous Leonid Kantorovich. Economics gives rise to many optimization problems for which traditional calculus is of little help. Kantorovich studied this new branch, now known as linear programming, long before its examination in the west. Alex spent seven years in Siberia, working primarily on mathematical economics, and its functional analysis underlying. During this period he began his long professional collaboration with an old friend Vladimir Demyanov. Their first book, \"Approximate methods in optimization problems\", was published in Russian in 1968 and translated into English in 1970.\r\n\r\nNext he went to the new university at Kalinin (Tver) between Moscow and Leningrad. After 4 years, he was able to return to Leningrad, where he stayed until 1988. His position there was at the Social Economics Institute, which dealt with the problems of socialist society. He remained productive and wrote the textbook \"Elements of Economic Theory\" with A.T. Nagiev, which was published in 1992. Alex and K. Shapiev also published a textbook for school teachers \"Elements of Mathematical analysis\". \r\n\r\nDuring this period Alex and Semen Kutateladze began to develop the theory of abstract convexity, detailed in their book \"Minkowski duality and applications\". Much of optimization theory is devoted to optimizing convex functions over convex sets, but convexity is lacking in many practical situations. A convex set can be defined as the intersection of sets defined by affine inequalities. If we replace these affine functions by a fixed but more general class of functions, called elementary functions, the resulting inequalities will define a more general class of sets, called abstract convex sets. Likewise, the pointwise supremum of a collection of elementary functions is called an abstract convex function. A particularly interesting case is when each elementary function is the pointwise minimum of a finite set of linear functions; then the abstract convex sets are star shaped. During this period, Alex and Demyanov introduced the theory of quasidifferential calculus, which arises from the need to optimize functions which are not smooth enough for traditional calculus. Rather than a single-valued derivative, they defined two compact convex sets, called subdifferential and superdifferential, and developed rules of calculus, leading to a linearization process for a significant class of functions. Quasidifferentiability does lead to good numerical methods for solving some complicated problems concerning moderately smooth functions.\r\n\r\nAlex had extensive contact with Azeri mathematicians beginning in the early 1980s. In 1989 he moved to the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences in Baku, as head of the Department of Mathematical Economics. The beginning of this period was very happy professionally, but the collapse of the Soviet Union, and subsequent economic deterioration, made life increasingly hard. In 1993 he emigrated to Israel.\r\n\r\nAlex spent 1993-95 at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in Beer-Sheva, unable to find a continuing position. His research fame led to an invitation from Barney Glover to visit Ballarat in 1994. Their successful collaboration led to his appointment by the University of Ballarat in 1996, first as a research fellow, and eventually as a professor and founding director of the Research Centre CIAO (Centre for Informatics and Applied Optimization). Under his leadership, CIAO successfully became a research centre of international repute. He considered the time spent in Ballarat to be his best years.\r\n\r\nIn Ballarat, Alex moved on from mathematical economics and concentrated on practical optimization problems, in particular the application of abstract convexity to global optimization. Together Glover, Alex, and former students Mikhail Andramonov and Adil Bagirov, developed the Cutting Angle Method. This can be used for global optimization of a Lipschitz function over a simplex. A natural outcome of this, Alex had been working more recently in monotonic analysis and non-linear Lagrange-type functions. Much of this is detailed in his last book, \"Abstract convexity and global optimization\". He organized a number of conferences in Melbourne and Ballarat, most notably ICOTA6 in 2004, and was active in advancing the Pacific Optimization Research Activity Group. He struggled with cancer for most of 2006, and passed away peacefully in September. Active right up to his passing, he had been honoured only four days earlier with appointment as the inaugural EUROPT Fellow by the Continuous Optimization Working Group of EURO.\r\n", :title "Memorial Session in Honour of Professor Alexander Rubinov", :keyword2 66, :authors (11537 3524 29121), :session 525}, 2923 {:keyword1 176, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Analyses were carried out on compensation payments to encourage protection\r\nof tropical forests and reduction of related carbon emissions within a\r\nrisk averting perspective.

The Government of Sri Lanka having accepted the results of this study has increased the employment opportunities for dental surgeons to optimize the dental human resource utilization to match the country’ s development.", :title "Using System Dynamics to address dental workforce issues in Sri Lanka: a practical approach in a developing country", :keyword2 0, :authors (29878), :session 429}, 2956 {:keyword1 21, :keyword3 0, :abstract "The strategy adopted by the Brazilian Biodiesel Program is to base its fuel production on grains acquired from small, family-owned farms in the poorest regions of the country, thereby fostering social inclusion and transfer of income. The success of the program depends on the development of a robust supply chain logistic structure, appropriate distribution of crop production, and investments in new grain crushing units. This article\r\npresents the development of mathematical models for optimizing the production arrangements for the supply of a biodiesel plant sourced from family farms, taking into account agricultural, logistic and industrial aspects, and the uncertainties inherent to the process. Three different approaches are proposed in order to deal with the problem stochasticity\r\nand cope with the investor’s risk tolerance profile. The models were successfully applied to a case study for the production chain for biodiesel fuel from castor oil in the semi-arid region of Brazil.", :title "Dealing with Uncertainties in the Bio Diesel Supply Chain Based on Small Farmers : A Robust Approach", :keyword2 0, :authors (29880), :session 429}, 2957 {:keyword1 21, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This paper presents a DEA-based decision-support methodology that has been\r\nimplemented and is being used by a not-for-profit organization, Fe y Alegría, which runs 439 Bolivian schools reaching over 160,000 disadvantaged students in that poverty stricken Latin American nation. Bolivia is a poor country with the highest percentage of indigenous population and the lowest per capita income in South America and as such its inhabitants are in dire need of effective educational resources to help them out of poverty. The DEA-based methodology described in this paper has offered an objective way to compare network schools among themselves and with out-of-network schools, providing a deeper understanding of school efficiency levels in the face of scarce resources, and allowing for sharing of best practices across the network. The paper introduces the educational environment in Bolivia, presents the DEA model, describes the decision support methodology, and provides two examples of its use. The first example compares FyA secondary schools with out-of-network secondary schools using publicly available data, and the second compares FyA secondary schools among themselves using a proprietary data-base. The paper also comments on lessons learned and the need for broad consensus-building and organization-wide buy-in for successful adoption and maximum impact.", :title "A Decision Support Methodology for Increasing School Efficiency in Bolivia’s Low-income Communities", :keyword2 0, :authors (8257), :session 589}, 2959 {:keyword1 178, :keyword3 133, :abstract "This article describes a multi-train mathematical model for rail networks capable of estimating the energy consumption of different tram and metro networks.
