These systems divide up a firm’s capacity costs (e.g., the cost of machinery and buildings) into pieces attributable to individual products and customers. Overwhelming evidence shows that managers worldwide use allocated costs for making product pricing and capacity planning decisions. For example, firms routinely drop product lines that do not recover their full (allocated) cost. Economists question this practice. They argue that the costs being allocated comprise of a firm’s committed /sunk costs. Thus, these costs or their allocations are irrelevant from a decision making perspective.  I aim to summarize recent research that seeks to reconcile theory with practice, and offer avenues for additional work.\r\n\r\nThe core idea of this research stream is the notion that a firm’s product- and capacity-planning problem is computationally complex. A conceptually correct formulation is multi-period stochastic optimization problem with complex linkages across periods (e.g. inventory) and constraints (e.g., multiple resources used by the same product). Accounting researchers argue that this problem is not solvable. They argue that product cost data can serve as economically sufficient statistics that permit problem decomposition. Such decomposition would permit managers to deal with pricing problems that pertain to individual products and planning problems that deal with each capacity resource. This research, which has many links to operations research, has examined questions under which such problem decomposition is costless and problem features that lead to a loss. Even when product cost is not economically optimal, it is reasonable to think of it as a heuristic that aids “local” decision making.  This view raises the question of the magnitude of the economic loss from using heuristics, as well as methods for improving our estimation. In particular, it is of interest to examine the sources of error (e.g., model specification, aggregation and/or measurement) and their implications for the accuracy of product costs. Simulations play a significant role in this research stream that has considerable practical appeal.

It is a political aim to make it possible for elderly to keep living in their own homes. The result is increased quality of life as well as lower total cost for providing the care as compared to retirement homes. The care is performed through visits to the elderly, and a wide range of services are performed, including, cleaning, washing, medical assistance and social support. The elderly care sector is labour intensive, and therefore good staff planning is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe planning of home care services involves many components such as scheduling of visits, routing of staff, matching between visit requirements and staff competences, fairness among staff members and quality of services. In addition, the daily operative planning has to deal with many last minute changes and is therefore difficult and time-consuming. \r\n\r\nThe City of Stockholm employs 47,000 staff members, of which 60% work within social care. The budget for 2008 is €3,9 billion, and social care to elderly citizens and disabled persons is the city’s most expanding activity. The City of Stockholm has been using OR based decision support system, Laps Care, in a number of units since 2003. The system is used to create the daily operative plans, in which visits to elderly are allocated to staff members. The planning considers geographic information, calculates travel times for several transportation modes (car, bike and walking).\r\n\r\nWith the system, the planning time is reduced by 2/3. This means that staff members can spend more time on visits, rather than participating in daily morning meetings. The use of resources is also more efficient, for example there is less need to call in extra staff. This has resulted in increased efficiency of 10 – 15 %. The qualitative aspects such as continuity and a fair work load level among staff members and security against missed or re-scheduled visits are considerably improved. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are 200 units with 4,000 staff members in 50 Swedish municipalities that are using Laps Care, and the annual savings reported are €20 – 30 million. During 2008/2009 the City of Stockholm is rolling out another 1,000 units with 15,000 staff members, and estimates to save €20 – 30 million for the city alone. \r\n", :title "Operations Research Improves Quality and", :keyword2 45, :authors (1666), :session 542}, 4443 {:keyword1 115, :keyword3 0, :abstract "Rosenhead and Mingers have classified Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs) for making progress with ill- defined, ‘wicked’ problems.\r\nSimple visualisation is commonly used in support of PSMs (eg rich pictures and strategy maps).

A well-known problem with the incentive-compatible Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism is that the resulting prices may not be in the core. Loosely speaking, this means the payments of the winners could be so low, that there are bidders who would have been willing to pay more than the payments of the winning bidders. Clearly, this “unfair” outcome is unacceptable for a public sector auction. Recent advances in auction theory suggest that combinatorial auctions resulting in efficient outcomes and bidder-Pareto-optimal core payments offer a viable practical alternative to address this problem. This paper confronts two critical issues facing the bidder-Pareto-optimal core payment. First, motivated to minimize a bidder’s ability to benefit through strategic manipulation (through collusive agreement or unilateral action), we demonstrate the strength of a mechanism that minimizes total payments among all such auction outcomes, narrowing the previously broad solution concept.
