For the stability of an MMIPP it is important that the process reaches a steady-state that is a point after which the duration of all stages for all machines is the same. It has been observed by R.A.Cuninghame-Green that a steady-state in MMIPP corresponds to the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem for production matrices in max-algebra. However, if the starting times vector of this process at the first stage is not an eigenvector then the question arises whether a steady-state is reached in a finite number of steps. This corresponds to the question whether the max-algebraic orbit of the production matrix will reach the eigenspace of this matrix. Matrices for which the answer is affirmative for arbitrary starting vector are called robust. We aim at providing a characterization of robust matrices and an efficient criterion for checking the robustness of matrices. The question of robustness fundamentally differs for irreducible and reducible matrices and we provide an answer in both cases. In the case of irreducible matrices robustness is equivalent to periodicity 1 of the matrix and can also be characterised using the dimensions of the eigenspaces of powers of the matrix. The case of reducible matrices is more complicated but the results for irreducible matrices are very useful for providing the answer.

The theory of optimality conditions for MPECs has benefited a lot from the recent developments of modern variational analysis. Conversely, theoretical questions arising in connection with MPECs have provided incentives to deep studies of calculus rules for nonsmooth and set-valued mappings.

Once the quotas have been assigned, agents can trade quotas among themselves, before they decide a level of individual investment on pollution abatement. This investment is privately observed by each firm. Then, production and emissions take place. Individual emissions are publicly observed and they are completely determined by the undertaken abatement investment and a firm specific random shock (following Mookherjee, 1984, RES, 51). There exists a moral hazard problem that we are interested in analyzing: the agency plays the role of a principal that selects a contract for each agent, and agents are connected through the emission permits market. Previous literature analyzes moral hazard problems in environmental situations, where the connection among agents comes from different facts. In particular, Alchian and Demsetz (1972) and Holmström (1982) analyze a team production problem, where the observable outcome is joint production. Also, Mookherjee (1984), considers a different connection among agents, assuming that the effort of a single agent influences other agent's production. Related to this, Holmström (1979) considers the existence of common-to-all agents shocks, where one agent's production might be statistically informative about other agent's effort. Instead, we consider a model where agents are only connected through the possibility of trading emission permits, and there exist firm-specific random shocks that influence the level of emissions. In particular, we study the following situation: An environmental regulator wants to induce a desirable level of abatement effort on each of two firms. These firms can use its resource to produce a consumption good or to reduce pollution. The regulator, first, assigns pollution emission permits among the firms and establishes a system of fines for over-polluting firms. Second, the regulator allows firms to trade emission permits. We are interested in analyzing the effects that this market has on the abatement efforts undertaken. Moreover, we study the connection between the efforts exerted by each firm.", :title "The air pollution emission permits market and moral hazard", :keyword2 0, :authors (13524 13525), :session 342}, 2516 {:keyword1 120, :keyword3 0, :abstract "We propose an efficient technique for optimizing the accuracy of aggregate and stream mining queries in the presence of sampling and load shedding.

Although the applications of LO are numerous, there are many real-life phenomena that cannot be described by a linear model, and hence the need for Nonlinear Optimization is apparent.

In this paper, we define the Crew Re-Scheduling Problem (CRSP). Furthermore, we show that it can be formulated as a large-scale set covering problem.

This problem arises in those assembly lines where we have certain limited resources available (normally workers) in which the operation time for every task is different depending on who executes the task, and where there are also some task-worker incompatibilities defined. The problem consists of providing a simultaneous solution to a double assignment: (1) tasks to stations; and (2) available workers to stations. After defining the mathematical model for this problem, a basic Branch and Bound approach with three possible search strategies and different parameters is presented. We also propose the use of a Branch and Bound-based heuristic for large problems and analyze the behaviour of both exact and heuristic methods through experimental studies. Finally the implementation of these procedures in a Sheltered Work centre for Disabled -the real environment which has inspired this research- is described. In these centres the adoption of assembly lines provide many advantages, since the traditional division of work in single tasks may become a perfect tool for making certain worker disabilities invisible. Efficiently applying this configuration helps these centres to achieve their primary aim: growth in order to provide more jobs for more disabled people, but always considering the specific limitations that the disabled workers have. In this sense this paper shows one of the possible real applications where Operations Research can help not only to get economic and productive benefits but also certain social aims.", :title "Branch and Bound Procedures for solving the Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Balancing Problem.
