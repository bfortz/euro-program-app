Examples include nonlinear power flow, gas transmission networks, the coordination of hydro-electric energy, finance, chemical engineering, and optimal control. More important, nonlinear optimization is a basic building block of more complex design and optimization paradigms such as integer and nonlinear optimization and optimization problems with complementarity constraints.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two competing classes of methods: active-set and interior-point. While both have their relative merits, interior-point methods have emerged as the computational leader. However, the Achilles' heel of interior-point methods is our inability to efficiently warm-start these methods. This deficiency is at odds with the rise of complex optimization paradigms such as nonlinear integer optimization that require the solution of thousands of closely related nonlinear problems and drive the demand for efficient warm-start techniques.\r\n\r\nWe review recent developments of new active-set methods that aim to close the computational gap between active-set and interior-point methods, whilst retaining the superior warm-start properties of active-set methods. We describe a new open-source framework for Newton-like solvers for nonlinearly constrained optimization problems. Our framework includes a variety of step-computation techniques and a range of step-acceptance strategies such as penalty function, filter, and funnel methods.\r\n\r\nWe describe new active-set strategies that avoid the solution of costly quadratic programs, and instead solve cheaper subproblems.
