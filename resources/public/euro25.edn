It defines a closed planar domain (skeleton core) describing possible position of a skeleton's essential part for any region with Hausdorff deviation from the figure not exceeding the given value.

Alternatively one could take a \"Super Constellation\" and go via Island in 24 hours. There were no electronic booking systems, customs-and passport control at each European Border, but no security systems at airports, no terrorism and no hijacking of planes. Communication was as clumsy: No fax, no email, no courier services, a letter between Europe and oversees took two to three weeks, each single letter had to be typed ,and there were neither social nets nor a www. Professionally there existed three large OR-journals (and a number of small national ones), East and West was separated by the Iron Curtain. \"Large\" OR-Societies existed in the USA, Japan and Great Britain and in Europe there were a dozen of smaller national OR Societies. There was hardly any communication between these European societies and if one wanted to know what was going on in OR in another European country, the best way was, to ask a colleague in the USA. In the USA Ackoff had stated (in 1979) \"American Operations Research is dead though not yet buried\".\r\nUnder these circumstances the presidents of the European OR societies met at the IFORS conference 1972 in Dublin and came to the conclusion, that this situation of OR in Europe was sub-optimal and should be improved. They met again in 1973 and 1974 and decided to organize the first European OR conference at the end of January 1975 in Brussels.

The second part will discuss ongoing research questions,\r\nnamely how the routing of the passengers can be included in the planning phases, how an integration of the planning phases can be simulated, and how robustness issues can be integrated. Theoretical and experimental results on these topics will be shown.\r\n\r\nPart 1 gives an overview on line planning, timetabling, and delay management. Given an existing public transportation network with its stops (or stations) and direct connections, the first step in the strategic planning of a transport system is to define lines and their frequencies. A line is a path in the public transportation network along which\r\nregular service is offered. We discuss various optimization models minimizing either the costs of the lines or maximizing the convenience for the passengers.\r\n\r\nIf the lines have been found, the next step is to design a timetable. There are two different models: Periodic timetables which are repeated on e.g. an hourly basis and aperiodic timetables. The usual aim is to minimize the traveling time for the passengers. Integer programming \r\nformulations will be provided for both problem types and algorithmic approaches for finding timetables will be reviewed.\r\n\r\nComing to the operational phase, the question of the delay management problem is how to react in case of delays such that the passengers' travel times do not increase too much. This concerns the decision if a punctual bus or train should wait for a delayed feeder bus or train or if it should better depart on time. In railway traffic also the limited capacity of the tracks has to be taken into account, i.e. priority decisions have to be made. Also here, the state-of-the art of delay management will be presented.\r\n\r\nThe three problems discussed in Part 1 can be solved more or less efficiently. However, the algorithms and approaches are still not suitable for solving real-world problems. In part 2 we will hence discuss features that are missing, identify the resulting research questions and show some first solution approaches aiming at making the algorithms work in practice.\r\n\r\nA first problem concerns the decision of the passengers. In many papers on line planning, time tabling, and delay management it is assumed that it is already known how the passengers travel, i.e. a passenger's weight is assumed to be known for every edge or activity in the system. This is an\r\nunrealistic assumption since the route choice of the passengers depends on the lines, the timetable and on the delay management strategy. We will discuss how the passengers' decisions may be integrated into the optimization process.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is robustness. It is not helpful to have an exact optimal solution that might get totally meaningless if a small disturbance occurs. Hence, the aim should be to have a robust transportation system which performs well even if the scenario or the input data changes. We exemplary illustrate different concepts on how robustness can be integrated for the timetabling phase.\r\n\r\nSpecialized algorithms for every single planning phase in public transportation are known. However, the best line plan is not helpful if it only allows bad timetables. Hence, some effort should be made to find integrated solutions. \r\n\r\nUsing our toolbox LinTim we illustrate how decisions made in earlier planning steps can influence the subsequent planning phases. Among others we show how the quality of a timetable depends on decisions made in the line planning phase, how good the approximation of the passengers' weights fits to the real behavior of the passengers, and how the robustness of\r\na public transport system may be simulated.\r\n\r\n", :title "Lines, Timetables, Delays: Models and Trends in Optimization of Public Transport ", :keyword2 106, :authors (1601), :session 1974}, 10981 {:keyword1 63, :keyword3 0, :abstract "This paper introduces a strategy for Pareto set refinement in order to allow where there will be more samples of the Pareto set.

To solve these problems, the unknown values of coefficients were mostly replaced by their observed past values. The obtained solutions were then feasible and optimal with respect to one, maybe very rare set of observed coefficients. The suggestion was to replace the deterministic view by a stochastic one and to assume that the unknown coefficients or parameters, say u, are random and that their probability distribution P is known and independent of the decision variables. A decision has to be taken before the realization of the random coefficients is known, using the knowledge of probability distribution P.\r\n\r\nThe prototype stochastic program (we focus on in the sequel) aims at the selection of the ``best possible\" decision x belonging to a decision space X subject to certain constraints. To build a decision model means to specify the set of feasible decisions and to define a real objective function which generates, independently of individual realizations of random factors, a preference relation on the set of feasible decisions. \"Hard\" constraints are usually reflected in definition of X. The outcome of the decision x which satisfies them depends on realization of random parameter u and is quantified as f(x,u). For different realizations one obtains different optimal values and different optimal solutions and the question is which of these decisions should be accepted. The common way is to use the expectation Ef(x,u) of the random objective function f(x,u) as the overall objective function, which is then independent of realizations of random parameters and exploits solely their probability distribution P. Numerous other criteria of optimality with such property can be constructed. The risk-adjusted expected return objective function of the Markowitz model, Markowitz (1952), is a well known early example. Of course, the choice of the criterion should reflect the purpose of the solved real-life problem.\r\n\r\nWhen the random factors appear also in constraints, one may require that the constraints are satisfied for all possible realizations, a request common in robust optimization. In this case, the set of feasible solution could be unnecessarily small or even empty whereas, depending on the solved problem, some violation of constraints might be tolerable. Hence, we have to specify which decisions will be accepted as feasible. Again several approaches can be utilized: \r\n\r\n* To use the expected values of the random constraint functions;\r\n\r\n* To require that the constraints are satisfied with prescribed probabilities for each constraint separately -- individual probabilistic or chance constraints, the idea of Charnes and Cooper (1958), or jointly for several constraints -- joint probabilistic or chance constraints;\r\n\r\n* To penalize constraints violations by a penalty q(x, u) assigned to decision x when it violates the constraints for the realization u and to incorporate the penalty term into the final objective function.\r\n\r\nFor stochastic linear programs a special type of penalty was designed: q(x, u) equals the optimal value of the second stage linear program which evaluates the effort for the cheapest possible compensation of discrepancies caused by the decision x when the realization u occurs. This approach is known as stochastic linear programming with recourse. The simplest choice of the second stage program, called now the simple recourse problem, appeared independently in Beale (1955) and Dantzig (1955); they suggested to distinguish and penalize two types of violations only.  \r\n\r\nThe significant progress in the seventies happened thanks to PrÃ©kopa (1971) who opened applications of models with joint probabilistic constraints. Another important extension, to multistage stochastic programs, has aimed at a more realistic treatment of the dynamic or sequential structure of real-life decision problems: When the information becomes known sequentially period-by-period, recourse decisions responding to the new information can be made; see e.g. DupacovÃ¡ (1995) for a brief introduction. \r\n\r\nThe theoretical results for various types of stochastic programming models were influenced and supported by achievements in optimization, probability and statistics and in computer technologies. In the 1980's, a special care to software development was initiated and has resulted in the IIASA volume edited by Ermoliev and Wets (1988). Areas of further prospective applications have been delineated. \r\n\r\nAt present there are standardized types of stochastic programming models (e.g., two-stage and multistage stochastic programs with recourse, models with individual and joint probabilistic constraints, integer stochastic programs) with links to statistics and probability, to parametric and multiobjective programming, to stochastic dynamic programming and stochastic control with relevant software systems available or in progress.  We refer to recent monographs and textbooks Birge and Louveaux (1997, 2011), Kall and Mayer (2005, 2011), Shapiro, Dentcheva, and Ruszczyski (2009), handbook edited by Shapiro and Ruszczyski (2003), collection edited by Infanger (2011) and to the stochastic programming bibliography by van der Vlerk (1996--2007).\r\n\r\nThe first applications appeared already in the fifties of the last century, e.g. Ferguson and Dantzig (1956), Charnes, Cooper, and Symonds (1958). They were based on simple types of stochastic programming models, such as stochastic linear programs with simple recourse and models with individual probabilistic constraints. Moreover, special assumptions about the  probability distribution P were exploited.\r\n\r\nBy now, significant applications of stochastic programming have been made in many areas, such as transportation, production planning and allocation of resources, management of hydropower and water resources, energy production and transmission, optimization of technological processes, \r\ntelecommunications, financial modeling and risk management.\r\n\r\nThere are many excellent recent papers on  successful large-scale real-life\r\napplications of stochastic programming. We refer to collections Ziemba and Mulvey (1999) for a selection of financial problems, Wallace and Ziemba (2005) devoted to non-financial applications, to Conejo, Carri{\\'o}n, and Morales (2010) focused on energy markets and collection edited by Bertocchi, Consigli, and Dempster (2011) on applications in finance and energy.\r\n\r\nStochastic programming is an example of a field which connects various areas of optimization, probability and statistics, numerical mathematics and computer science with the broad territory of operations research.\r\nThe success of applications is conditioned by a close collaboration\r\nwith users and it benefits from the team work. Even if implementation of complex stochastic programming models frequently requires simplifications and/or approximations, their outcome may point at new decision strategies. \r\n\r\nWe shall focus on the modeling issues. From the modeling point of view,\r\nstochastic vehicle routing, stochastic networks and stochastic facility location problems have been  mostly treated as a natural extension\r\nof the stochastic transportation problem with simple recourse, whereas individual probabilistic constraints have appeared in the context of the stochastic nutrition model and in water resources management models.\r\nThe impressive early collection of case studies related to real-life applications of joint probabilistic constraints was edited by PrÃ©kopa (1978, 1985); it reflects the prevailing interest in applications to water resources problems at that time.\r\n\r\nTo apply stochastic programming means primarily to be familiar with the real-life problem in question, its purpose, constraints, and with the available level of information concerning the influential random factors.\r\nIt is important to exploit the problem structure and to be aware of alternative models. One can consider different objective functions and to model the same problem using probabilistic constraints or penalizing the constraints violation or to combine both. Very often there is no convincing reason why to prefer one approach to another. The choice of model is tied to the data structure and it is frequently influenced \r\nby the decision maker's individual attitude and the software available. To use the penalty or recourse approach means to quantify the losses caused by the considered discrepancies, which may be a difficult task for the decision maker, who often prefers to assign probabilities ad hoc and to solve a stochastic program with individual probabilistic constraints. This model, however, does not distinguish the magnitudes of constraints violations. \r\n\r\nWe shall illustrate the modeling issues and the interplay between the problem setting and the stochastic programming model building by selected examples related mainly to water resources management and planning; see e.g. PrÃ©kopa (1978, 1985), DupacovÃ¡ (1979), DupacovÃ¡ et al.

An overstatement, perhaps, but only a slight one. As a consequence, over the past three or four decades, dynamic programming has been an essential tool, including in my own research. In quantitative aggregate economics, dynamic programming plays a key role from model formulation to model calibration to computation of model outcomes. In the process, for example, of calibrating a model economy, its steady-state relations are an essential part of what it takes to work backwards from empirical relations among variables to what the model parameters must be in order to be consistent with them. With advances in the development of theory and computers becoming much more powerful, the set of interesting questions that can be addressed with such models has expanded dramatically in the past decade or two. This is true especially for questions that dictate the inclusion of important heterogeneity across current generations and/or across individuals more generally.\r\n\r\nIn models with a role for the government, anticipated future policy affects economic behavior in earlier periods. For example, future tax policy affects investment behavior today. If we imagine policy to be selected so as to optimize an objective (welfare) function, the resulting policy, in the absence of a commitment mechanism, is generally time inconsistent. Aside from questions about its implementation, then, a consequence is that the formulation of the optimal-policy problem is not recursive. But one can generally convert such a model into a recursive structure by introducing an additional pseudo-state variable â a shadow price â which is subject to its own constraint implied by the model.
