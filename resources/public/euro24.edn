In capacitated models for SCOP, the planned lead time is made conditional on some (restriction of) the work-in-process (WIP). The choice of the planned lead time and WIP constraints heavily influences WIP levels and how efficient resources can be utilized. We explore these relations for a PU that is represented by a single server with generic service times.

We solve an dynamic optimization problem where employees' contributions are proportional to their salaries and the final target functions relates to variables traditionally the domain of defined contribution pension funds such as substitution rated (ratio between annuities and last salaries) .This framework aims to become over time a new planning and advisory benchmark for the new generation of hybrid DC plans.", :title "Optimal DC-type pension fund management", :keyword2 35, :authors (19822), :session 309}, 2585 {:keyword1 83, :keyword3 133, :abstract "We present the stochastic outer approximations algorithm for robot trajectory planning.

In particular, we make use of a non-differentiable exact penalty function. We show that, under weak assumptions, there exists a threshold value of the penalty parameter such that any global minimizer of the penalty function is a global solution of the related constrained problem and conversely. On these bases, we describe an algorithm that, by combining an unconstrained global minimization technique for minimizing the penalty function and an automatic updating of the penalty parameter that occurs only a finite number of times, produces a sequence of solutions such that any limit point of the sequence is a global solution of the related constrained problem.

There is no textbook approach currently available, although illustrative case studies of varying pedagogical utility do exist. The methodology introduces elaborate conceptual novelty and technical language, although some of its tools are arguably but formalizations of decision making processes that might otherwise receive scant attention. The methodology emerged through an intricate historical and philosophical background, although one that weaved theoretical developments with perceived practical necessities. The literature presents the methodology as available in two distinct modes, although only one has received the most scholarly attention. And, perhaps most challenging of all, its inherent flexibility renders it difficult to categorize: it can be taught as an exploratory approach, a formal decision making approach, an organizational learning vehicle, and it may even be used in part, in whole, iteratively or not, and even in conjunction with other methods. Indeed, the very question of whether SSM is a methodology or a method is debatable and will influence the pedagogic approach taken. Finally, it is an approach designed to help decision makers tread through the complexity and uncertainty generated by systems of interrelated problems. Where a usual recourse in such situations is to computerized decision support systems, none are available to accompany a process led by SSM. A formal pedagogical approach to SSM will be presented. The aim is to provide teachers and trainers with the confidence to communicate the relevance of the approach in a transferable manner that students/clients can then use in their careers. The focus will be on the so-called Mode 1 of SSM, this being the one most heavily discussed in the literature. However, based on recent research, a complete reconfiguration of the structure of this Mode will be presented. As such, one novelty lies in how SSM may be understood through a new configuration, one that emphasizes decision making, but also one that emphasizes the interrelated logic between all the tools and concepts used in the methodology. In addition, a useful multimethodological input will be provided with the use of cognitive mapping in one particular part of SSM. In sum, the paper concentrates on teaching SSM as a formal decision making approach which simultaneously enables understanding of the entire methodology and its related parts.

Total working time of a product in the most industrial factories dealing with a set of deteriorating tasks is important because of its costs. So this paper introduces the effect of task deterioration in to the total working time of a product in a straight assembly line. Task deterioration means that a task processed later consumes more time than the same task when it is processed earlier. The following assumptions are considered in this research:\r\n- there are a fixed number of workstations in a simple straight assembly line,\r\n- there are a set of dependent tasks that should be assigned and scheduled to each workstation while considering the precedence relations between the tasks, \r\n- every task should be performed only one time in each cycle,\r\n- at each workstation, there is a multi-skilled machine able to perform all of the tasks assigned to that workstation, \r\n- there is a single product to be processed,\r\n- it is assumed that no machine breaks down when performing each task assigned to it. In other words, interruption is not allowed. On the other hand, pre-emption is not allowed,\r\n- setups are assumed to be negligible,\r\n- planned machine idleness is not allowed, but idleness could occur for the difference of the station time and the cycle time, \r\n- performance time of each task consists of two main parts: a fixed part, and a variable part which depends on the delay in the start time of the task and its deterioration coefficient,\r\n- production manager desires to obtain the optimal tasks' schedule corresponding to minimum value of the total working time (because of tasks' deterioration) while suggesting a virtual value for the worst cycle time. In other words, production manager does not accept tasks' schedules and assignments with larger cycle time than what he proposes based on his previous experiences (as an upper bound for cycle time).\r\n\r\nThen the problem is formulated via a mathematical model.

To honor the Hungarian mathematicians whose ideas had been used, it was called the Hungarian Method. In 2005, Francois Ollivier discovered that the posthumous papers of Carl G. J. Jacobi contain an algorithm that, when examined carefully, is essentially identical to the Hungarian Method. Since Jacobi died in 1851, this work was done over a hundred years prior to the publication of the Hungarian Method in 1955.\r\nThis lecture will provide an account of the mathematical, academic, social and political worlds of Jacobi, Konig/Egervary, and Kuhn. As sharply different as they were (Prussian monarchy, Hungary under the Nazis and the Communists, and the post-war USA), they produced the same mathematical result.\r\nThe lecture will be self-contained, assuming little beyond the duality theory of linear programming.

(This project of work could be described as work along the lines of the (old) \"Nash program\", seeking to reduce the study of \"cooperative games\" to the area of the (theoretically simpler) study of \"equilibrium\" in \"non-cooperative games\".)\r\nThe theoretical key for the inter-linking of these areas is the concept of the \"evolution of cooperation\" (in Nature) which has been studied both by theoretical biologists and by game theorists.\r\nOur key idea for the reduction of a process realized through cooperation to a process achieved by actions taken independently (and separately) by the Players that are involved in the game context lies in the introduction of moves (or actions) of \"acceptance\" together with the supposition of an indefinitely repeated game context in which the Players may react (in punishing fashions) against unfavorable actions on the part of other Players. Our model designed for this purpose has the players strategically making \"demands\" in relation to the behavior of the other players.\r\nAnd at the same time any Player also chooses, strategically, how he (or she) will allocate the resources available to a coalition if he (or she) has become accepted (through acceptance elections) to have that power. As it happens, in short, the studied model, for a game with three players, involved 39 strategic parameters to be controlled by the players, and we represented it in terms of 42 variables.\r\nThere was a substantial challenge of computation to find game theoretic solutions. These were sought in terms of PURE STRATEGIES. And the game example itself, although being described by a characteristic function giving rise to three numerical parameters setting the payoff benefits accessible by specific coalitions, was an \"NTU game\" rather than a game with \"transferable utility\". However we have compared solution results with corresponding indications for the games deriving from the Shapley value or from the nucleolus.\r\nThe general context of computations is found to be quite challenging. We have used Mathematica in the connection with the work done up to now.
