An important feature of this approach is the possibility of handling inconsistencies in the preferential information. The methodology is based on elementary, natural and rational principle of dominance. From an algorithmic point of view, the set of decision rules constituting the preference model is induced from the preferential information using a knowledge discovery technique properly adapted, so as to handle the dominance principle. The mathematical basis of the decision rule approach to MCDA is the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA).
